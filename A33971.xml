            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:43194:4"/> comfort and example of thoſe who are alive, that others may learn the ſteps of holineſs, by which ſhe aſcended that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Manſion into which we believe her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and by which ſhe mounted to that <hi>pinacle of honour</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of God, upon which we lately ſaw her, and which her <hi>memory</hi> yet poſſeſſeth. This <hi>(Madam)</hi> being determined, I had no difficulty to find out to whom I ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them. Both the <hi>ſubject matter</hi> of the diſcourſes, and your <hi>Ladiſhip</hi>'s near relation to her <hi>Ladiſhip</hi> challenged that at my hands. The deſign of the ſheets <hi>(Madam)</hi> introductive to the ſequent Narrative of her <hi>Ladiſhip</hi>'s life, is to evince a great truth to the world, concerning which the practical errours, which we daily ſee in it, give us reaſon to believe it not ſufficiently perſwaded, <hi>viz. That the perſon fearing the Lord is the moſt excellent perſon.</hi> Were the world better convinced of this moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable Propoſition, thoſe perſons would not find it ſo difficult to reconcile the world unto them, and to gain a quiet room, in the latitude of it, wherein to <hi>paſs the time of their ſo journing here with fear;</hi> only leading ſuch a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
<pb facs="tcp:43194:4"/> as might comport with the <hi>fear of God,</hi> according to the degrees of light they have received. Thoſe <hi>Madam,</hi> who know the value of perſons <hi>fearing Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> muſt from principles of reaſon have a kindneſs for every one whom they ſee afraid to ſin againſt that <hi>great and glorious Name,</hi> though that <hi>timoration</hi> makes them recede from them in ſome practices, wherein they could deſire them to be like themſelves. But <hi>Madam,</hi> how unreaſonable ſoever the more peeviſh world ſheweth it ſelf in their judgement of, and behaviour to ſuch perſons. Your <hi>Ladiſhip</hi> hath for many years declared your ſelf to have a juſter apprehenſion, and teſtified it both by your own choice of the <hi>right waies of the Lord,</hi> and your exemplary kindneſs to thoſe whom you have found walking therein. Theſe Papers, <hi>Madam,</hi> will juſtifie your <hi>Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>'s judgement, and may poſſibly help to confirm what your <hi>Honour</hi> hath ſo long believed.</p>
                  <p>To the latter part of theſe ſheets your <hi>Ladiſhip</hi> is entituled by your near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to that <hi>Honourable perſon</hi> whom they concern, and the intireneſs of affection, which you mutually bare
<pb facs="tcp:43194:5"/> each to other. She ſeldom mentioned your Ladiſhip in your abſence; but the form of her mention was, <hi>My dear Siſter of Exeter.</hi> With your <hi>Ladiſhip</hi> it was that ſhe conſulted in her difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, refreſhed her ſelf in her dark and ſad hours; to whom therefore doth her <hi>Picture</hi> more of right belong, than unto your ſelf? It might indeed have deſerved a better hand, but as it is, I dare ſay your <hi>Ladiſhip</hi> will ſee many a <hi>line</hi> in her <hi>countenance,</hi> which you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and ſay, <hi>Sic vultus, ſic illa manus, ſic ora ferebat,</hi> that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding like your Ladiſhips noble Siſter. If your <hi>Ladiſhip</hi> asketh why it cometh ſo late after her Funerals, I muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Madam,</hi> that your <hi>Honour</hi> is not altogether ignorant what hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to me ſince that time; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, the Copy of theſe ſheets were in the Stationers hands more than two years ſince, and unhappily (through his ſlowneſs) periſhed in your <hi>dreadful Burning:</hi> ſince which I have indeed had time enough to have revived them, but have been diſtracted with ſo much bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of other natures, as before this time I have not been able to finiſh what
<pb facs="tcp:43194:5"/> long ſince I intended, and had begun. They now come forth not in ſo good a dreſs as I could wiſh, but as imperfectly as works uſe to do, finiſhed in ſo many parts as I have been inforced to finiſh them in, and by.</p>
                  <p>Such as they are, I moſt humbly offer them to your <hi>Honour,</hi> as a ſmall obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the memory of her to whom your <hi>Ladiſhip</hi> knows I owed much more; and as a poor acknowledgement of the many obligations which it hath pleaſed your <hi>Ladiſhip</hi> to lay upon me, who have no way, but ſuch as this; and my fervent prayers to approve my ſelf</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43194:12"/> Her mother was like the <hi>cloud</hi> unto her, when <hi>ſhe moved to Court the Daughter moved alſo, when ſhe ſate at home the daughter moved not at all.</hi> I have often heard her mention it to the great honour of her Mother, <hi>That ſhe would require her conſtant attendance upon her ſelf; both going to the Court,</hi> and <hi>returning from it;</hi> and ſhe was to her mother as the <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions ſervant</hi> unto him. If they ſaid unto her <hi>Go</hi> ſhe went, if they ſaid <hi>Come,</hi> ſhe came, if <hi>Do this,</hi> ſhe did it. Having attained to riper years ſhe frequently was at the Court of King <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>Queen Ann,</hi> and was in great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with that <hi>Queen,</hi> and <hi>King Charles</hi> the firſt, then <hi>Prince of Wales.</hi> I do not remember any thing I have heard from her much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous as to this <hi>part of her life,</hi> unleſs <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſad reflexions</hi> upon her ſelf, for miſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of many <hi>Lords dayes,</hi> in <hi>masks,</hi> and other <hi>Court paſtimes,</hi> according to the faſhion of others in her circumſtances. This ſhe would often <hi>mention with bitterneſs,</hi> and <hi>honourably mention</hi> and prefer before her ſelf one of her <hi>Noble Siſters,</hi> who in her youth had a juſt ſenſe of that errour, and courage enough to reſiſt the temptations to it. It was the only thing in which I ever heard her repent her obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to, and attendance upon her <hi>Mother,</hi> whom yet ſhe thought exceeding <hi>pious,</hi> and paid alwayes a juſt honour to her <hi>mention</hi> and <hi>memory;</hi> which reverence ſhe had alſo for her Noble Father. I remember the <hi>Paſſion</hi> ſhe fell into when ſhe heard of his death (though I communicated it to her with as much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43194:12"/> as I could to hinder ſudden paſſions) which made me as the Jews cry out, <hi>Behold, how ſhe loved him!</hi> The ſequel of this diſcourſe will evidence that it is not through want of more momentous matter, that I inſtance in theſe things of more minute conſideration: But I have the rather mentioned them, to let my <hi>Readers</hi> ſee, how far we are degenerated from the ancient culture of youth, and that orderly Diſcipline, under which thoſe <hi>male and female Worthies</hi> were educated, who have <hi>done famouſly</hi> in our <hi>Ephrata,</hi> and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably is one great cauſe of that <hi>impudent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs</hi> which diſhonoureth the preſent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
                  <p>The Generous Soul of this excellent <hi>Lady</hi> was ordained to higher things than <hi>Balls,</hi> and <hi>Maſques,</hi> and <hi>Viſits.</hi> It now grew time for a <hi>Plant</hi> bred under ſo rare a <hi>cultivation,</hi> to be <hi>removed</hi> into another <hi>place,</hi> That her God might have the glory, and her <hi>generation</hi> the fruit of ſuch an education. Her native <hi>beauty,</hi> and the rare parts ſhe began to diſcover, made many <hi>noble perſons</hi> deſire her in marriage, but to ſhew how early ſhe was mortified to the <hi>vanities</hi> of youth, with the approbation of her Parents, ſhe at laſt <hi>choſe</hi> a <hi>Widower</hi> for her firſt, and only husband: Sir <hi>John Hobart</hi> of <hi>Blicklin</hi> in the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Norfolk, Baronet;</hi> he was the eldeſt Son of Sir <hi>Henry Hobart</hi> at that time <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Chancellour to the Prince.</hi> A Perſon indeed (as to title) in the loweſt order of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> but one whoſe Eſtate bare a full proportion to his quality,

                  <p>In her Conjugal Relation ſhe was now more perſpicuous, ſhe was now planted upon an hill, where thoſe rare ſeeds which had been ſown in her ingenuous Soul during her <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi> began to ſpring up, and bring forth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant fruit, in that triple capacity to which this relation (in ſome little ſucceſſion) intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her, that (I mean) of 1. a <hi>Wife</hi> to a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Husband. 2. <hi>A Parent to Children,</hi> and 3. a <hi>Governeſs to a numerous Family of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi>

My deſign was (it being a Family of much leiſure) to bring it up to a <hi>Courſe of Prayer</hi> (in conformity to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Copy, <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening</hi> and at <hi>Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time; Reading ſome portion of Scripture</hi> twice each day, and <hi>expounding it,</hi> as my leiſure would allow me) <hi>Catechizing</hi> once every week, a <hi>ſtricter obſervation</hi> of the Lords dayes, and <hi>Repetitions</hi> of <hi>Sermons,</hi> both on that, and other dayes, when we had attended upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinances. I did not do this, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it what God requireth of all Families, but in regard, I thought God expected more of us to whom he had given more leiſure from diſtracting occaſions of the World: Partly, in regard my hands at that time were not ſo full of more publick employment, but I could attend this more than ordinary ſervice in the Family; and indeed, becauſe I thought I ſaw the Family ſo much behind hand as to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual knowledge, as ordinary performances in a ſhort time were not like to reach the end which I aimed at.</p>
                  <p>As to the generality of the Servants, I fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this might prove <hi>like the putting of New</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:43194:18"/> 
                     <hi>Wine into old Bottles,</hi> and be <hi>judged a yoke they were not able to bear.</hi> I therefore firſt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated my thoughts to my Lady (Sir <hi>John Hobarts</hi> ſickly ſtate not allowing much liberty of diſcourſe at that time). Her <hi>Ladyſhip</hi> chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully approving my thoughts, propounded them to her <hi>husband,</hi> who with <hi>great expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of thankfulneſs,</hi> teſtified his <hi>approbation</hi> to me, and commanded his Servants diligently to attend the duties; and himſelf, when his diſtempers would permit him, was never ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ordinarily (for ſome time) at our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. At <hi>Noon</hi> and <hi>Night</hi> he was with us. The Morning Service was by <hi>ſeven of the Clock,</hi> rarely after eight, from which her <hi>Ladyſhip,</hi> unleſs in a bed of ſickneſs) in eighteen years I think was hardly twice abſent, and was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily with the firſt of the Family in the room where they were performed, before her ſicklineſs brought them to her own Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>The buſineſs of <hi>Catechizing</hi> was more <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,</hi> yet made eaſie by theſe <hi>noble Parents,</hi> prevailing with their own Daughter, to go before the Family in a <hi>noble Example,</hi> which ſhe continued untill ſhe had attained a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent knowledge in the moſt neceſſary Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Religion.</hi> From the time I firſt came into the Family, it pleaſed God to keep Sir <hi>John Hobart,</hi> in a dying condition (though he had ſome more lucid intervals than other:) within leſs than eight moneths God removed him into a better life. It was his great <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> all along his ſickneſs to ſee his <hi>dear</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:43194:19"/> 
                     <hi>Daughter,</hi> making ſuch a proficiency in the knowledge of the <hi>things of God,</hi> and ſo willing to ſet an example to his Family; and he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned it as his <hi>dying comfort,</hi> that he had ſeen his Family before his death in a courſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which he doubted not but his <hi>Lady</hi> would bring to perfection.</p>
                  <p>Now was this <hi>Excellent Lady</hi> brought to the third and laſt period of her life. Now ſhe ſate <hi>ſolitary as a Widow;</hi> mourning as a Turtle that had loſt her <hi>Mate,</hi> and for a while not knowing how to receive comfort becauſe <hi>He was not.</hi> Having recovered her ſelf from her paſſion, and learned to hold her peace becauſe this was the <hi>Lords doing,</hi> ſhe made it her firſt requeſt to me, that I would abide with her, and keep on the courſe of Religious dutyes in the Family, which I had began, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to me an high <hi>incouragement</hi> from an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that I ſhould find her, propoſing to her ſelf the pattern of the man according to Gods own heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 1, 2, 6, 7. endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>walk in her houſe with a perfect heart.</hi> That <hi>thoſe who were of a froward ſpirit ſhould depart from her:</hi> That <hi>her eyes ſhould be upon the faithfull in the land, they ſhould ſerve her.</hi> That <hi>he who wrought deceit ſhould not dwell in her houſe; he that told lies ſhould not tarry in her ſight.</hi> To which reſolution ſhe was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards very ſevere. The times began to be troubleſome, through the diſtempers of the Army, and ſome fears began then to ariſe, that Miniſters, who could not comply with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43194:19"/> the extravagancies of that time ſhould not be ſuffered to enjoy their publick liberty: Her <hi>Ladyſhip</hi> partly to obviate that Evil, partly to give her ſelf advantage (however times fell) to do good to the Souls of many; at no ſmall charge, converted ſome leſs uſefull <hi>lower rooms of her houſe</hi> into a <hi>Chappel</hi> which was conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently capacious of more than 200 perſons. Here ſhe obliged me at firſt to preach a <hi>Lecture</hi> every week, and to repeat one or both of my Sermons every <hi>Lords Day at night,</hi> after the more publick Sermons were finiſhed in the Town, which for 16 years was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a very full <hi>Auditory,</hi> and to the great advantage of many younger perſons, and of thoſe who had not ſuch advantages as they deſired in their own houſes, for hearing again what they had been hearing in the day time. A work of piety the more remarkable for this, her <hi>Ladyſhips Chappel</hi> lying in the way to that field where the younger perſons were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wont to profane the latter part of the Lords day, by idle walks, diſcourſes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, intercepted many of them, and proved a <hi>bait</hi> to allure them both (from the example of it) into a further reverence of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> and (from the Doctrine they heard there) to bring them to a further acquaintance with God. After this ſhe ingaged me alſo to preach a Morning Sermon there on the Lords dayes (thoſe monthly dayes only excepted when I was to adminiſter the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Lords Supper more publickly). This
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43194:20"/> courſe her <hi>Ladyſhip</hi> continued ſo long as I had a liberty to preach, or her Ladyſhip a liberty to <hi>hear.</hi> But, that I may ſpeak more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly:</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtian Philoſopher</hi> divideth all vertue into <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Probity;</hi> which indeed is our Saviours diviſion of the whole Law into the two Precepts: <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart;</hi> and <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> We muſt firſt conſider her Ladyſhips obedience to the <hi>firſt,</hi> and then to the <hi>ſecond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Even from her Childhood ſome ſeeds of ſeverer piety began to diſcover themſelves in her. I have heard her mention the <hi>pleaſure</hi> ſhe then took in reading Mr. <hi>Dod's Expoſition</hi> of the <hi>Commandements.</hi> Then (as I have heard her relate it) her pleaſure was in thoſe Miniſters whoſe Doctrine was moſt lively, and whoſe lives were moſt pure and holy. But her ſelf would conſtantly own the fixed change of her heart to have been wrought by God under the Miniſtry of that eminent Servant of God, Mr. <hi>John Carter,</hi> late Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of St. <hi>Peters Mancraft</hi> in <hi>Norwich,</hi> of whom ſhe was a conſtant Hearer. Her pious Soul having thus <hi>been kindled</hi> with an holy fire, quickly flamed in a <hi>Goſpel converſation,</hi> her <hi>light ſhining out ſo before</hi> others, that <hi>they ſaw her good works, and glorified her Father which was in Heaven:</hi> And I doubt not but many in the view of them, <hi>glorified God in the day of their Viſitation.</hi> I know not whether (in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43194:20"/> the memory of any) the City of <hi>Norwich</hi> was bleſſed with any perſon of her quality, who in any proportion to her, incouraged the wayes of God with her Purſe, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them by her unparallel'd example.

She ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſpent <hi>half an hour</hi> either in a <hi>Dinner</hi> or <hi>Supper,</hi> and both ate and drank in ſo ſmall proportions, that (not denying allowances for particular conſtitutions) ſhe was a perfect demonſtration, <hi>how little Nature would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with:</hi> ſhe was ſo far from taking pleaſure in <hi>coſtly raiment,</hi> that for ſome years after the loſs of her <hi>dear husband,</hi> ſhe could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to <hi>wear a ſilk Gown;</hi> and profeſſed to do it, that ſhe might have abundantly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve poor Chriſtians in want: and when at any time, ſhe ſaw an <hi>object of charity</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a greater proportion than ſuited her <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtock</hi> of money, ſhe would yet do it, telling me, <hi>it was but wearing a Gown</hi> two or three <hi>moneths longer:</hi> For <hi>Muſick, Dancings, Gamings,</hi> her ſerious mortified Soul was grown a perfect ſtranger to them.</p>
                  <p>Untill ſome few years before her death, when infirmities increaſing upon her, ſuffered her not to do as formerly. This was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe of her life. She ſeldom was in her bed after Four of the Clock in the morning, (towards her latter end, her health inforced
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43194:21"/> her to abide in it longer; yet to the laſt, Seven was her utmoſt hour): from the time ſhe roſe till Seven of the Clock, ſhe ſpent her time in the private Devotions and retirements of her Cloſet; then ſhe came out to the more publick duties of the family, which ſhe never miſſed, and ſeldom but was firſt in the room, in Prayer, Reading the Scriptures, Expounding, one or more of theſe Exerciſes (as opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſerved) and ſome diſcourſes afterward ſhe then uſually ſpent more than an hour, the reſt of her time till Noon was ſpent in her Chamber in dreſſing, or in her Cloſet, reading, looking over Accounts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes for half an hour ſhe walked. Then ſhe came out again to Prayer in her Family, in which, and in Dinner, and following Diſcourſes ſhe uſually ſpent two hours, and ſometimes exerciſed her ſelf for half an hour afterward. Her afternoon was ſpent in reading, or making Viſits chiefly to ſuch Chriſtians, as ſhe had an Intereſt in; or ſometimes in <hi>ſpinning</hi> or <hi>ſowing</hi> with her Maids. About Six she again came to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-duties: in which, at Supper, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes after it, she ordinarily ſpent three hours, and then withdrew to her Cloſet, for many years together there she abode reading and praying till Twelve or One of the Clock: till at laſt with no ordinary difficulty, she was perſwaded by her <hi>learned Phyſitian</hi> to abate an hour or two of that exceſs, for her health ſake. Thus she lived a moſt mortified life to all the contents of this World, excepting only what aroſe from Communion with God, and his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43194:22"/> people; uſing as great ſeverity to her ſelf as thoſe who judge ſuch Caſtigations of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the price of Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Poſitive part</hi> of St. <hi>Pauls deſcription,</hi> in the firſt place reſpects Religion; ſo he deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth her to be one, 1. <hi>Truſting in God. 2. Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in ſupplications night and day. 3. Caring for the things of the Lord, that ſhe might be holy in body, and minde, and ſpirit.</hi> The firſt is an <hi>internal,</hi> the ſecond a <hi>more external Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Truſting in God,</hi> as it ſpeaketh our <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret affiance</hi> in, and <hi>adherence to</hi> the <hi>promiſes</hi> for this life or that to come, is ſo ſecret an act of the ſoul, that oft-times, the Soul that doth it, cannot diſcern the truth of its own act, much leſs can another diſcern it otherwiſe than from the effects. Some of thoſe effects, which will come neareſt the certain diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this habit, are, an <hi>unfained love to the Word and Ordinances of God; Freedom from diſtracting eares for to morrow; Love to God; Fear of offending him; Hope in his mercy,</hi> &amp;c. How much this admirable <hi>Lady</hi> valued <hi>the Word</hi> and <hi>Ordinances of God,</hi> was conſpicuous to all that knew her, moſt to us who had the advantage of more intimate communion with her: Beſides that ſhe was rarely to be found alone without her Bible before her, ſhe had drawn up for her ſelf a method for read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture (to which ſhe was very ſtrict) ſo as every year ſhe read over the <hi>Pſalms</hi> Twelve times, the <hi>New Teſtament thrice,</hi> and the other part of <hi>the Old Teſtament once.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, that ſhe might want no ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43194:22"/> to any doubt ariſing upon her reading the Scripture, ſhe had furniſhed her ſelf with a large Library of Engliſh Divines, which coſt her not much leſs than 100 <hi>l.</hi> of which ſhe made a daily uſe: She was (while in health) unweariable in her attendance upon Sermons, ſuch eſpecially where the Truths of God were opened moſt lively, and with leaſt vanity, and in fulleſt evidence of Scripture; ſhe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily heard three or four Lecture Sermons in the week, and three on the Lords day, till her diſtempers ſo prevailed upon her, that ſhe could not attend them without that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs which ſhe was loth to diſcover, and which was her great affliction. This her love to the Word argued that ſhe had choſen the Promiſes in it for her portion, and had caſt her Soul upon them; how elſe were they ſo precious to her?</p>
                  <p>She was indeed a <hi>Lady</hi> exerciſed with her <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> and <hi>love-jealouſies;</hi> rather evidences for, than againſt this adherence to her <hi>dear Lord.</hi> I have ſeen her in great <hi>ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> and <hi>conflicts,</hi> and almoſt refuſing to be ſatisfied, but could never find that they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued more, than an earneſt thirſting after <hi>further evidences</hi> of divine love than it pleaſed God for ſome time to <hi>vouchſafe her.</hi> She was poſſeſſed indeed of a <hi>Noble Eſtate,</hi> and ſo had not that temptation as others to <hi>diſtruſtfull cares</hi> for the things of this life; yet ſo far as ſhe could, ſhe exerciſed this act of faith, never <hi>caring for to morrow,</hi> nor conſidering what it <hi>might bring forth:</hi> But freely ſpending her
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43194:23"/> whole revenue <hi>in pious and charitable works</hi> (that of it I mean which ſhe could ſpare from the frugal expenſes of her houſhold) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing ſhe deſired no more, than to make her accounts of <hi>Receits</hi> and <hi>Disburſements</hi> even at the years end. Her <hi>love to God</hi> was beyond the <hi>love of Women,</hi> whether we view it in the more ſecret motions of her ſoul, or in more <hi>imperate acts:</hi> What ſighs? what heart-breaking ſadneſs, have I been a witneſs to from her, when ſhe lay (at any time) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der apprehenſions of any degrees of divine deſertions? or any ſuſpicions of the truth of Grace in her own heart: What tears (in ſuch dark hours) have I ſeen flow from her eyes in her Cloſet more privately? What groans have I heard from her, while we have been praying more publickly? On the other ſide, if at any time, ſhe could have laid hold upon any good Word of God, if ſhe had found any more freedom of ſpirit or heart, or felt what ſhe judged an Efflux of divine love upon her Soul, What a chearfulneſs did we all the day ſee in her countenance? what freedom did we diſcern in her converſe? It was no hard matter for me from the obſervation of her converſe and countenance in the day-time, to judge how it had ſared with her <hi>Ladyſhips ſpirit</hi> in her addreſſes to God that morning. Her <hi>dread of God</hi> was exceeding great. I have ſometimes trembled to hear with what earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe would adjure me to be faithfull to her in the buſineſs of her Soul, and <hi>not to ſuffer ſin to reſt upon her.</hi> Her fear indeed was for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43194:23"/> ſome time too too ſervile, favouring too much of the <hi>ſpirit of Bondage,</hi> but it was afterward, more <hi>conſtantly Filial,</hi> in all things diſcovered by a <hi>reverential ſenſe of the great and glorious Majeſty of God,</hi> and a fear of <hi>wilfull ſinning</hi> againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Nor was this Excellent <hi>Lady's Religion</hi> ſuch as to evince it to the World, ſhe was put to flee to the plea of <hi>a good heart</hi> as a Sanctuary. Out of the abundance of Grace in her heart her mouth ſpake, her whole outward man moved in a juſt conformity to her <hi>external profeſſion:</hi> She was exemplarily diligent and devout in all Religious performances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prayer</hi> was her great delight. To that form are the firſt ſpiritual words which the Childe of God ſpeaketh. The firſt account we have of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> after his converſion was, <hi>Behold he prayeth,</hi> and this ſeemeth to have been the firſt ſtudy of this <hi>Excellent Lady:</hi> In the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal performance of which, ſhe found ſome difficulty, to relieve her ſelf in which, ſhe had furniſhed her Cloſet with moſt valuable Engliſh books, which contained <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi> upon ſeveral occaſions; in none of which ſhe could find a <hi>full ſatisfaction,</hi> but ever and anon ſhe was ſtill at a loſs for words fitted to the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>complexion</hi> of her ſpirit. To help her ſelf, she procured her Paſtor to draw up ſeveral Forms fitted to the frame of her Soul, at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times: And in this work when I was come into her Family she often imployed me, but ſtill she remained diſſatisfied, that she gave us ſo frequent troubles, and that after
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43194:24"/> ſome years owning her ſelf to be <hi>Gods childe,</hi> she should in any exigent be at a loſs for words to take unto her ſelf, and to ſay <hi>Abba Father.</hi> I humbly adviſed her to a praevious ſtudy of the more general matter, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Prayer, and of the <hi>Divine Promiſes,</hi> which are the ſacred Obligations which <hi>Prayer</hi> puts in ſuit. As to the former, I drew up for her Ladyſhip a <hi>Scheme</hi> (which she kept hanging before her in her Cloſet to her dying day, deſcribing to her the plainer and more ordinary method, and the more general mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and commended to her ſome Books which gave the fulleſt account of the <hi>Promiſes.</hi> After ſome ſmall exerciſe of her ſelf in both of them, ſhe needed her <hi>Prayer-books</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> no longer, but was able (as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion miniſtred it ſelf) to pour out her Soul to God according to her neceſſities, without any further <hi>Monitor</hi> than the <hi>Spirit of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> in conjunction with the pious work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of her own breaſt. And indeed after this ſhe was no friend to <hi>Forms,</hi> she judged that they could never be uſed <hi>with that warmth of affection, which attends the words of a good Chriſtian, formed in his own heart: That whoſo limited himſelf by them would never from his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance in duty underſtand any thing of the frame of his heart. And that no knowing perſon could have other need of them, than as a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement for his own lazineſs, neither ſtudying the Scriptures nor his own Heart.</hi> Whatever be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined as to her judgement in the eaſe, her <hi>Ladyſhip</hi> for 15 or 16 years before her
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43194:24"/> death would not allow her ſelf the uſe of them. She prayed much in her Cloſet, Thrice each day in Communion with us in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
                  <p>She was as diligent in <hi>hearing the Word,</hi> ordinarily hearing three Sermons on the Lords Day, and more Lectures in the Week-day, till her increaſing diſtempers (of late years) more indiſpoſed her. Her <hi>Sabbath</hi> day <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> and the hearing of one <hi>weekly Lecture</hi> which her Ladyſhip at her own charge erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and maintained, ſhe continued while ſhe was able to go down ſtairs, yea and after that in her <hi>Bed-chamber</hi> to her dying-day.</p>
                  <p>Once every month, ſhe (in Communion with us) received the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and that not without <hi>praevious preparation</hi> before ſhe came, and moſt <hi>ardent devotion</hi> when ſhe was preſent at that ſacred Inſtitution. Of her private Faſtings, and extraordinary times of Prayer, I ſhall ſay nothing, though in them ſhe was not wanting.</p>
                  <p>Her <hi>love</hi> to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>ſervants</hi> of God was beyond compariſon; ſhe had not only <hi>(like the Shunamite)</hi> prepared a <hi>Table,</hi> a <hi>Bed, and a Candleſtick for the Servants of God who paſſed that way,</hi> but (like <hi>Lydia)</hi> ſhe would adjure them (if they judged her faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) to come to her houſe. To this purpoſe ſhe had ſet apart one Chamber in her own houſe, to which ſhe had given the name of <hi>The Miniſters Chamber.</hi> She highly prized any <hi>laborious Godly Miniſter,</hi> and that for his works ſake; and ſhe had as little kindneſs for any
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43194:25"/> 
                     <hi>who attended not their Work, or whoſe lives de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed their Doctrine, and Function,</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the colour, and form of their Coat to make them known: ſhe had indeed a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar kindneſs for ſome, but a <hi>great love</hi> for all, whom by any thing ſhe could diſcern de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving from Chriſt, and dedicating their time and hearts to his ſervice. So far as I could eſtimate it, ſhe every year ſpent the fourth part of her Revenues upon <hi>good Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>poor Chriſtians.</hi> Her charitable acts were like that pious act of <hi>Araunah,</hi> of whom the Scripture ſaith, <hi>As a King he gave unto the King.</hi> What ſhe did of this nature, ſhe did nobly, and a very large heart and hand God had given her. How often hath <hi>ſhe lodged ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, relieved the afflicted, waſhed their wounds</hi> (inſtead of their feet) waſhing of which being not our guiſe? How <hi>diligently did ſhe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low every good work?</hi> Her <hi>Coach</hi> was ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſeen waiting for her, at the doors of <hi>poor</hi> and mean perſons, whiles others (like <hi>Michal)</hi> looked out at their <hi>wanton Windows,</hi> ſaw it, and mockt. It pleaſed her <hi>Ladyſhip</hi> when ſhe came home to fancy what the wanton Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants of the Town ſaid, <hi>How glorious was the Lady</hi> Frances <hi>to day, ſpending her time in Viſits to poor Knitters?</hi> She had an anſwer ready (with a ſmall alteration) from <hi>the man</hi> according to Gods own heart, <hi>It was before the Lord,</hi> with ſuch as he hath choſen to Eternal life, leaving <hi>Vain perſons</hi> to periſh in the recompence of their iniquity.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:43194:25"/>
                  <p>While others were meaſuring the ground with their idle feet, ſhe (upon her <hi>bended knees)</hi> was taking her turns with God, and taking the heighth of the third Heavens: While they were diſcourſing of the <hi>Mode,</hi> in this or the other habit, ſhe was diſcourſing with poor Chriſtians upon <hi>ſick</hi> and <hi>Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds,</hi> about the <hi>long white Robe of Chriſts righteouſneſs;</hi> the <hi>New Name,</hi> the <hi>white Stone,</hi> the <hi>Chains about the Saints necks;</hi> while they were laughing, and pleaſantly buſied at their <hi>Feaſts, Balls,</hi> and <hi>Playes,</hi> ſhe was in her Cloſet, <hi>mourning,</hi> and offering up to God the <hi>ſpiritual ſacrifice</hi> of <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears,</hi> both for her ſelf and them. She was of our Divine Poets mind, that <hi>Kneeling never ſpoiled Silk-ſtocking,</hi> nor <hi>Gown neither,</hi> and that Chriſtian <hi>Cottages</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſhonoured a more ſtately Coach. I have known ſome very mean Chriſtians (but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of great grace, and great experience in the wayes of God) from whom lying on their beds of afflictions, ſhe would hardly be two dayes abſent; nor did ſhe judge any time too long to ſpend with them. She would often ſay to me, that ſhe believed <hi>Love conſtrained equally</hi> (if not more) <hi>in ſpiritual Relations, than in thoſe that were natural;</hi> and when in her dark hours, ſhe ſometimes ran the fate of other Chriſtians, wanting ſuch evidences of Grace, as ſhe deſired to have found, ſhe would from this relieve her ſelf, that if St. <hi>Johns Argument</hi> were infallible, 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 14. We know that we have paſſed from death to life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we love the Brethren,</hi> ſhe yet had a ground
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43194:26"/> of hope, for if her heart did not ſtrangely deceive her, ſhe <hi>loved them,</hi> and that <hi>becauſe of their holineſs,</hi> &amp;c. nor was ſhe any of thoſe that ſaid ſhe had <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>had no Works.</hi> None of thoſe whom St. <hi>James</hi> reflects upon, Who <hi>if a Brother or Siſter were naked, and deſtitute of daily food,</hi> would ſay to them, <note place="margin">James 2. 15, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Depart in peace, be you warmed, and be you filled, notwithſtanding gave them not thoſe things which were needfull to the Body.</hi> Her love did not evaporate, and ſpend it ſelf in an empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed Viſit, or meer pitying of ſuch as were in affliction, ſhe many wayes refreſhed their bowels, if ſhe found their bodily diſtempers difficult, ſhe would ordinarily ſend her own <hi>learned Phyſician</hi> to them (who himſelf was a <hi>Luke</hi> too towards ſuch as feared God) if ſhe found them under ſpiritual trouble, ſhe would direct me to them: She would put her own hands to their wounds, ſend them diſhes from her own Table, when ſhe had been with them at any time like the good <hi>Samaritane</hi> in the Goſpel, when ſhe came away she would take out money from her purſe, and give to Nurſes, ſaying to them, <hi>Take care of this perſon, and whatſoever you ſpend more, when I come again I will repay you.</hi> Her ſelf denyal in all acts of piety, and charity to the ſouls and bodies of others, was the juſt admiration of all ſober perſons in the place where God had fixed her, for which she was univerſally honoured, even by thoſe who were of far different com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions from her.</p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:43194:26"/>
                  <p>Nor was she at all <hi>moroſe</hi> in her converſe. Her <hi>piety</hi> taught her <hi>civility,</hi> and <hi>affability,</hi> and a <hi>readineſs to do good to all,</hi> though her delight (according to that of <hi>David)</hi> was in thoſe <note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 3.</note> whom she apprehended dear unto God; and she was (according to the Apoſtles direction) moſt abundant in <hi>doing good</hi> to thoſe of the <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>houſhold of Faith.</hi> Though her Expences were great and noble, yet thoſe upon her ſelf were <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>inconſiderable:</hi> She cared not to be known by ſo <hi>pitifull a badge of Honour as Coſtly Apparel,</hi> but was far more ambitious, of purchaſing to her ſelf an <hi>honourable report</hi> from good works, which yet she did not to be ſeen of men, and was carefull as to the moſt of them, that they should neither be taken notice of in the doing, nor that any record should be left of them, her deſire was to have praiſe not from Men but from God. <hi>Landes quia merebatur contempſit, &amp; quia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempſit magis merebatur:</hi> So little did she af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect applauſe, that drawing her <hi>laſt will</hi> (at leaſt the Preface to it) with her own hand whiles I had the liberty of my <hi>publick Miniſtry,</hi> she willing me to preach at her Funerals, added (as I remember theſe very words) <hi>And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to forbear all commendations of me, a vile ſinfull Creature.</hi> Thus did this <hi>Noble Lady go in and out before us,</hi> commending the holy wayes of God, not only to all in the houſe with her, but to all that dwelt round about her. Thus did she shine in her <hi>Horizon;</hi> she was not a <hi>reed ſhaken with the winde,</hi> not one carried about with every winde of Doctrine;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43194:27"/> she was not a perſon known by her cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>coſtly rayment</hi> (yet she had been no ſtranger to Kings houſes) she was a <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a ſhining light,</hi> and for many years the people of God, in the <hi>City of Norwich,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in her light, to ſay nothing of more extraordinary advantages, they injoyed at leaſt three opportunities each week for hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word of God at her <hi>Ladiſhips</hi> charge. <hi>But ſhe, according to the will of God had</hi> (with <hi>David)</hi> ſerved <hi>her generation,</hi> and her time now was come when ſhe muſt <hi>fall aſleep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It muſt and may be owned (for ſhe judged it no blot upon her honour) that ſhe was a <hi>Non-conformiſt</hi> as to ſome <hi>Modes of Worſhip</hi> in preſent uſe; as well as to ſome <hi>Doctrines</hi> more now in credit than formerly: for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhe was beholden to her <hi>Noble Father,</hi> who (as it was ſaid before) early prejudiced her againſt the <hi>Arminian principles,</hi> and for the former, ſhe was wont to acknowledge it to thoſe who had the charge of her tender years, who ſowed thoſe ſeeds, which afterwards brought forth this fruit, indeed nothing ſo prejudiced her againſt <hi>forms of Prayer,</hi> as her own experience of them. For the two or three laſt years of her life therefore, ſhe reſtrained her ſelf to thoſe exerciſes of Religion, which were performed within her own walls, or in ſome other places not ſo publick. As to which ſhe yet injoyed a great liberty, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that honour which perſons of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions had for her. It was not the will of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43194:27"/> God ſhe ſhould long ſurvive that <hi>liberty,</hi> which was ſo precious to her. The Lords day next preceding the time when the <hi>Act reſtraining</hi> religious meetings took place, was (if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member right) the laſt time ſhe went down her ſtairs; I remember while I helped her in going up the ſtairs from her Chappell to her Chamber, that night ſhe told me, <hi>The Act would do her no prejudice, for ſhe ſhould never go down more.</hi> This (as I remember) was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the latter end of <hi>June,</hi> or beginning of <hi>July,</hi> 1664. The <hi>Dropſie</hi> (her fatal diſeaſe) had three or four moneths before ſeized upon her, but death (by it) made ſuch gradual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, that till that time ſhe was able (without much diſturbance) to walk up and down. That very night (as I remember) was the firſt time, that ſhe complained of her leggs failing her to that degree, yet was her life lengthened out till the latter end of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> following: Indeed her whole life was a time of Afflictions, through the valetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narious condition of her Noble Husband; the loſs of Children, and her own ſubjection to diſtempers, through <hi>ſtubborn ſplenetick obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Nor was ſhe for ſome years before with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome proſpect of <hi>the death</hi> by which ſhe ſhould dye, though it was a kind of death, which ſhe above all others dreaded, and would often ſay concerning it, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible let that Cup paſs from me.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Concrete,</hi> which argueth a great <hi>Emphaſis.</hi> It is in the Hebrew very <hi>Emphatical;</hi> word for word, <hi>A woman, the fear of the Lord.</hi> Some think it a meer Ellipſis of the Verb Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and to be expounded by <hi>Cui eſt,</hi> that is, A woman that hath <hi>the fear of the Lord.</hi> But others more probably think there is in this way of expreſſion a ſpecial <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> and that it ſignifieth an eminent degree of that <hi>quality</hi> or <hi>adjunct,</hi> which is ſo expreſt, in the ſubject to which it is applied. A way of ſpeaking very familiar to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue. Thus <hi>Haggai</hi> 2. 8. Chriſt is called, <hi>The deſire of all</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hag. 2. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Nations;</hi> that is, eminently deſirable. Thus a Shepherd is ſaid to have been an <hi>Abomination</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 46. 34</note> 
                     <hi>to the Egyptians, Gen.</hi> 46. 34. that is, highly abominable; his employment ſuch as the Egyptians above all others deteſt. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 140. 12.</note> 140. 12. <hi>Let not an evil ſpeaker,</hi> [Heb. a man of tongue] <hi>be eſtabliſhed.</hi> Nor is it unuſual in other languages. Thus in <hi>Latine</hi> we call one <hi>Scelus,</hi> that is eminently vile; in Engliſh we call one a <hi>Beauty,</hi> that is eminently Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. So here, a woman, <hi>the fear of the Lord,</hi> that is, a woman <hi>eminently fearing the Lord.</hi> So that whatſoever qualities we ſhall find in Scripture expreſſed under this <hi>common head</hi> of <hi>the fear of the Lord:</hi> or whatſoever <hi>actions</hi> we ſhall find according to the phraſe of holy writ expreſſed under that notion; this form of expreſſion ſignifieth a perſon eminent for thoſe <hi>qualities;</hi> or in thoſe <hi>exerciſes;</hi> and the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43194:34"/> phraſe ſignifieth much more than an ordinary dread of God. To open this yet a little further:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is <hi>a natural dread of God,</hi> which all creatures have, and the worſt of men are not without ſomething of it: For fear being in us a paſſion neceſſarily moving upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of an imminent evil. As the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſuperiority of God over his creatures makes every rational creature preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it in his power to do it harm, it muſt neceſſarily dread him; eſpecially conſidering the natural conſcience of guilt, which every ſuch creature hath, expoſing it to the ſtroke of his juſt, as well as almighty Arm.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>ſlaviſh fear of God:</hi> ſuch the <hi>Devils</hi> have; they <hi>fear and tremble</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) this doth but gradually differ from the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>filial, reverential fear of God;</hi> like that wherewith the child feareth his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Angels have a reverential fear of God, though they know themſelves confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in goodneſs, and in no poſſibility of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; yet they fear God with a <hi>reverential fear,</hi> ariſing from the apprehenſion of the <hi>ſuperlative excellencie</hi> of the great Creatour above the firſt-born, and moſt excellent of his Creatures. Thus the <hi>children of God</hi> fear him, and not only with a <hi>reverential fear,</hi> but with a <hi>filial fear;</hi> they fear leſt they ſhould offend him. This laſt is the moſt excellent <hi>fear of God.</hi> Now of it there are different degrees according to the different manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43194:34"/> of the Spirit of God to his Saints and Chriſtians different proficiencies in grace. Now this way of expreſſing this excellent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſignifieth; <hi>One poſſeſſed of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent kind of fear, and alſo in the moſt eminent degree.</hi> And this I take to be the particular <hi>Emphaſis</hi> and <hi>Energy</hi> of the term in this place.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is a known Rule in Divinity; <hi>That words in holy Writ ſignifying any notions of the ſenſes and affections; yea and of the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual part alſo, there uſed, muſt be underſtood not to denote only the particular acts of that ſenſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Verba ſenſus &amp; affectum &amp; effectum denotant.</note> 
                     <hi>or faculty which they properly expreſs, but all the actions, and the deportment of the whole ſoul, and outward man alſo, which are any way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by that ſenſe, or regulated by that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or paſſion, and our duty in order to it, or conſequently from it.</hi> Without the true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this Rule, we ſhall not be able fully to comprehend the true ſenſe of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Scriptures. Thus it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 6. (with reference to God) that <hi>he knoweth the way of the Righteous.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 6.</note> is, he <hi>loveth, approveth, watcheth over</hi> the way of the righteous. Thus <hi>Pſal. 16. Thou</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>wilt not ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption;</hi> that is, to corrupt, to experience corruption. So <hi>John 8. Abraham ſaw my day and rejoyced;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">John 8.</note> the meaning is, he <hi>foreknew</hi> ſuch a day, he <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</hi> it, he <hi>hoped for it</hi> and <hi>rejoyced.</hi> So <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in Scripture often (indeed moſt ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily) ſignifieth much more than bare <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> viz. <hi>hearkening, attentive hearing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:43194:35"/> 
                     <hi>obeying.</hi> So for words ſignifying <hi>Paſſion.</hi> Thus the <hi>wrath and anger of God</hi> in Scripture, when it is threatned, doth not only ſignifie Gods juſt will to puniſh, but alſo his acts of vindicative juſtice. <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſinned againſt him:</hi> That is, I will bear thoſe puniſhments which the wrath of the Lord hath brought upon me. So here. <hi>The fear of the Lord</hi> doth not only ſignifie an inward awe and dread of God cauſed by the Spirit of God, in the hearts of creatures, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the apprehenſion of Gods <hi>Majeſty, Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Power, Glory, Goodneſs,</hi> or other <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes;</hi> but it alſo importeth, all thoſe <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal acts,</hi> all that <hi>outward deportment</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour</hi> which <hi>naturally</hi> flow, or which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the divine rule ſhould flow from that principle. So that the <hi>woman fearing Jehovah, is not only ſhe, who in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Majeſty, Power, Greatneſs, Glory, Juſtice and Goodneſs of God, reverenceth and dreadeth him, carrying in her heart a continual awe of the great God of Heaven and Earth, which makes her heart and thoughts ſtoop and bow at the meditation or hearing of him</hi> in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that infinite <hi>Majeſty, Glory, Greatneſs and Power,</hi> which naturally require that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage from <hi>every reaſonable nature; but alſo in the whole of her converſation, in all her actions, both before and towards God and men (in obedience to that principle of Religion) [Fear] exerciſeth her ſelf in all things to keep a good conſcience void of offence,</hi> not daring to do
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43194:35"/> any thing which may provoke this God to diſpleaſure whom ſhe thus dreadeth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exactly careful to do all things, which, and as he commandeth. This is the woman <hi>fearing Jehovah,</hi> ſo far as we have yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her. But this is not all which this term importeth. Once more.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is very ordinary, as in other Writings, <hi>ſo in holy Writ,</hi> by a figure called <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> to <hi>expreſs a part of a thing for the whole.</hi> Look as the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſaith of moral virtues, <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes ſunt concatenatae,</hi> the Virtue (like beads) are all ſtrung in a chain; and none can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be denominated virtuous, who in ſome degree or other hath not all habits of virtue. So I may ſay in matters of grace. The graces of Gods Spirit are in a chain too. <hi>Thou haſt raviſhed my heart, my Siſter, my Spouſe, thou haſt raviſhed my heart with one of the chains about thy neck, Cant.</hi> 4. 9. A man cannot have one, but he muſt have all of them; nor from a ſingle habit can any be denominated a gracious perſon, in regard of this concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of grace. It is ordinary in Scripture to find a gracious perſon expreſſed, <hi>Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochically;</hi> under the notion of one ſingular ſpecial habit of grace (eſpecially <hi>ſome one more principal operative habit.)</hi> Now of all habits, there are none more operative than thoſe of <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Love:</hi> None that take more hold on the ſouls, or whoſe influence upon it is more evident. Hence in Scripture it is very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to find an holy, gracious, perſon expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed under the notion of <hi>one fearing God</hi> [or]
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43194:36"/> one that <hi>loveth God.</hi> Divines have obſerved, that the former is more common to the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which gives account to the Church of God, under its <hi>Paedagogical eſtate,</hi> when the diſpenſation of the Covenant of Grace was more terrible, and the latter to the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> where it is <hi>more ſweet.</hi> Thus the grace and godly converſation of <hi>Obadiah, 1 King.</hi> 18. 5. of <hi>Job, Job</hi> 1. 8. of the whole body of ſeverer profeſſors, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and ſo very frequently, and in the New Teſtament, where the diſpenſation is more ſweet and gentle, it is more ordinary to expreſs the ſame things, under the notion of <hi>believing</hi> and <hi>loving,</hi> 1 John 4. 21. <hi>He that loveth God,</hi> John 21. 15. <hi>Simon Son of Jonas,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">James 2. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>loveſt thou me?</hi> Jam. 1. 12. <hi>To them that love him,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 8. <hi>Thoſe that love his appearance.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. and in many other places. But yet though (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) <hi>we be come now to Mount Sion, and we have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear, but the ſpirit of Adoption, teaching us to cry, Abba Father.</hi> And (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect love caſteth out fear.</hi> Yet thoſe texts muſt not be underſtood of an awfull, reverential fear and dread of God (ſuch as even the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels have: Nor yet of that <hi>filial fear of God,</hi> which every child of God hath, and muſt carry with him even to the gates of Heaven; but only of <hi>ſervile ſlaviſh fear:</hi> for even under the New Teſtament we ſhall find the ſervants of God expreſſed under this Notion.

                  <p>That which (in ſhort) is ſaid of her, is that ſhe <hi>is the moſt excellent woman:</hi> There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others praiſe-worthy in their order and kind; many to whom <hi>ſua laus debetur;</hi> but there is none like unto her; ſhe hath (to ſpeak in the Hebrew dialect) <hi>aſcended above them all.</hi> Others may deſerve ſome praiſe, but <hi>ſhe ſhall be praiſed;</hi> ſhe in the moſt eminent manner deſerveth praiſe. Two things then are ſaid,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>She is the moſt excellent perſon.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The latter juſtly followeth upon the former. That therefore is it alone which I ſhall inſiſt upon, and the general queſtion is,</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Wherein it doth, or may appear, that a woman fearing the Lord</hi> (in this ſenſe) <hi>is the moſt excellent woman, that perſon the moſt excellent perſon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The commendation in the text being in the <hi>ſuperlative degree,</hi> the moſt natural way to demonſtrate the truth of the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is that which <hi>Solomon</hi> here directeth us to, <hi>per modum comparationis,</hi> comparing her

This therefore is the method which I ſhall follow, having the Holy Ghoſt himſelf for my guide. I will then</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Enquire what thoſe things are, which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>They are all of them the gifts of God,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> though they be not of his choiceſt and beſt ſort of gifts, yet his gifts they are, and not the portions of all perſons. <hi>That one is more nobly and ingenuouſly born,</hi> is Gods gift, who breathed his ſoul into a finer piece of clay than anothers. He is our <hi>Potter,</hi> and they are his hands that have ſhaped <hi>one body</hi> into a more lovely and beautiful form than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and hath knit the joynts of one more ſtrong than anothers. It is he that hath given to one a quicker underſtanding, a more dexterous wit and fancy, a more ſolid judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a more tenacious memory, a more active ſpirit than another.

It is he that hath more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the mind of one than another to moral vertue, meekneſs, ingenuity, courteſie, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, &amp;c.

It is he that hath given to one a greater eſtate than to another; and by whoſe guidance and aſſiſtance one doth more noble and virtuous actions than another. <hi>Promotion cometh not from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South, but God is the Judge, he pulleth down one, and ſetteth up another,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 67. 6, 7.

Now I ſay, this putteth an excellency upon the things themſelves, and alſo upon the perſon poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with them; whoſo hath them, hath more to ſhew for a favour that God hath to him, than he that wanteth them, unleſs he hath this ſame excellent thing in my text.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>ſecond thing</hi> which commendeth theſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or ſome of theſe things, is, their <hi>uſefulneſs as to our comfortable being and ſubſiſtence in this life. Riches</hi> and <hi>Favour,</hi> though they be things more external and forein to what truly makes up a reaſonable creature, or adorneth him, conſidered in that capacity; yet they have this excellency in them, that whoſo is poſſeſſed of them, is at a better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage than another man for a comfortable ſubſiſtence in the world, and to do good to others, than he that is poor, and of no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and reputation in the world. <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>health of body</hi> (upon which ſtrength you know much depends) are neceſſary and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to us, for our comfortable ſubſiſtence. An <hi>Active, buſie, diligent ſpirit,</hi> is that alſo which maketh rich (through the bleſſing of God) and upon this account all theſe things have a true and real excellency in them, and ought to be looked upon as the bleſſings of God, which we ought to acknowledge
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43194:41"/> and to receive with thankfulneſs at his hand.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There is an excellency in ſome of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> them, and which they give to the perſons that are poſſeſt of them, which lies in their <hi>approvableneſs to the reaſonable nature of man.</hi> All of them do not ſo approve themſelves to our rational part; reaſon underſtands not the excellency of great parentage, or a fair face, nor of riches, or honours, &amp;c. But now <hi>knowledge, prudence, ſobriety, temperance, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,</hi> with other moral virtues, are things which have in them a certain innate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural beauty, even reaſon being Judge, and make the perſon poſſeſſed of them as much to excite another that is <hi>ignorant, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt, impudent, intemperate, fooliſh,</hi> as light excelleth darkneſs; and upon this account it was that the wiſer Heathens valued them, though they knew nothing of the revealed mind and will of God in reference to them, and conſidered them not at all as falling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a divine precept, but only as improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of nature, and due products of a ſoul that had not loſt its reaſon, and was not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſed by debauchery. The Heathens had no other eye than that of reaſon; no other ballance than that in which to weigh things that differed.</p>
                  <p>And now I think we have made a juſt eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of other things (the fear of the Lord only excepted) which either do, or may put a value upon any perſon in this world above his neighbour: we have ſeen what they are,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43194:41"/> and how much they ſignifie. The ſumm is this, That there are many things which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther really, or at leaſt in common opinion make a man or woman to excel; <hi>Bodily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſtrength, health, beauty; mental endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, knowledge, judgement, wit, prudence; moral vertues, temperance, ſobriety, &amp;c. An active diligent ſpirit</hi> and temper, fitted for bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in our reſpective callings; <hi>things more external,</hi> ſuch as <hi>honour, eſtate, favour, credit</hi> and <hi>reputation.</hi> And though it be very uſual (as I have ſaid) to over-rate theſe things, and to overvalue perſons bleſſed with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of them; yet theſe things, conſidered as the gifts and favours of God, and as things of ſingular advantage to us, with reference to the comfortable beeing and ſubſiſtence of our outward man in the world; and as ſome of them are naturally far more approvable to the reaſonable nature of man, than their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries have ſome true, real worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in them; and perſons poſſeſſed of them, may (in their degrees) be juſtly judged more excellent and valuable than thoſe that want them. But the perſon <hi>fearing Jehovah,</hi> is yet the moſt excellent perſon. Others up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the aforementioned accounts, have <hi>aſcended,</hi> (to uſe the <hi>Hebrew</hi> phraſe) or do excel many others in the world: But the perſon that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently <hi>feareth the Lord,</hi> hath (as the text ſpeaketh) eminently <hi>aſcended above them all.</hi> Amongſt them all, there is none like to that perſon, and that brings me to the next thing which I promiſed you in the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Let us but argue rationally, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of men. If there be any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in the favour of a man; or if the collation of a mans favour, doth imprint any excellency upon the perſon upon whom it is beſtowed; then certainly the more any one hath of that <hi>favour;</hi> or the greater and higher degrees he hath of it, the more he hath of excellency. The ſtory is known of the Emperour, who diſpleaſed his Courtier
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43194:44"/> by giving him a <hi>Ring,</hi> when he gave another a <hi>kiſs:</hi> what was he angry for? the Ring for uſe in the world, was more worth than a kiſs.

When the Lord giveth unto any <hi>ſtrength, beauty, riches, honour,</hi> they are but as ſo many <hi>Rings:</hi> But where he gives his fear, there he gives the <hi>kiſs;</hi> and this ſpeaketh a greater excellency in the fear of the Lord, and in the perſon bleſſed with it, than in any other thing, or perſon: the ſoul that hath this, hath indeed aſcended above them all; in the favour of God that ſoul hath aſcended above them all. As you ſee, the ſtrength of this demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dependeth upon theſe two <hi>poſtulata.</hi>

                     <hi>ſubject which the fear of the Lord bleſſeth.</hi> Or if you will, the <hi>ſpecial channel</hi> in which it runneth; or indeed the <hi>capacity</hi> in which it bleſſeth the ſoul. Take the moſt of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43194:44"/> gifts, they only innance the price and value of the outward man. <hi>Beauty</hi> is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in the ſurface of the body; <hi>ſtrength</hi> in the nerves and bodily parts; <hi>riches, honour, favour,</hi> great <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>relations,</hi> they are indeed the gifts of God, and of great uſe and advantage; but the advantage of them is from their uſefulneſs, to the well-being of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, and the accommodation of a man in this life. Some indeed of the things afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned innoble the inward man; that doth <hi>knowledge, prudence, moral vertue.</hi> Some diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>body,</hi> the <hi>mind,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit.</hi> The Apoſtle ſeemeth to allow that diſtinction, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 23. If it be allowable, <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 23.</note> none of the things aforeſaid <hi>(the fear of the Lord</hi> only excepted) reach further than the <hi>mind,</hi> that is, the ſoul of a man conſidered as a a <hi>rational ſubſtance.</hi> Look upon the ſoul as a noble <hi>immortal beeing,</hi> under an ordination to an eternal exiſtence in happineſs or miſery; and theſe things ſignifie little to it. A noble perſon may go to Hell. A rich and honourable man; a knowing prudent man; a comely, beautiful perſon, <hi>may have their portion in the lake that burns with fire and brimſtone.</hi> Yea, and the Apoſtle ſaith, not many of them will go to Heaven; <hi>Not many noble, not many wiſe, &amp;c.</hi> But now the moſt noble inward part of man; and that not conſidered only as a rational ſubſtance, but in its moſt excellent capacity, ordained to eternity, is the ſubject wherein this excellent quality reſides. That which it bleſſeth. The price of the body is
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43194:45"/> raiſed by ſtrength, beauty, a good and healthy conſtitution. The price of the mind is raiſed by <hi>knowledge. wit, judgement, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> and by <hi>moral vertues.</hi> But the value of the ſoul conſidered as a <hi>ſpiritual beeing,</hi> that is immortal, and under ordination to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is raiſed <hi>by grace,</hi> by the <hi>fear of the Lord,</hi> and indeed by that only. This is that which marketh out a ſoul for Heaven, while ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is left in the road to everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The ſeat of this <hi>noble quality</hi> is not the ſurface of the outward man, (which is the throne of that pitiful thing which the world ſo much doteth on) which we call (beauty) nor yet the bones, ſinews, nerves of a man, which are the ſeat of <hi>ſtrength:</hi> nor the <hi>head of a man,</hi> which is the ſeat of knowledge and prudence: nor the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the <hi>rational part</hi> of a man, which is the ſeat of <hi>moral vertue,</hi> where it ſitteth as a <hi>Queen,</hi> and giveth Laws to <hi>brutiſh paſſions,</hi> and all <hi>motious of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive appetite:</hi> But it is the <hi>immortal ſoul</hi> conſidered as a ſpiritual ſubſtance, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to immortality and life, and an eternal exiſtence.

It is an uſual ſaying amongſt Philoſophers, <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus cujuſque eſt quiſque.</hi> The mind of the man is the man. It is much more true of the ſoul, conſidered in the capacity I mentioned. The bodies indeed of the Saints are called <hi>The Temples of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> but it is by reaſon of the redeemed ſouls which inform them. The Holy Ghoſt dwelleth in the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43194:46"/> whole perſon of the believer as his Temple. The body is but as the <hi>Outward Court</hi> into which common excellency comes; ſuch as <hi>ſtrength, beauty, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>mind of man</hi> is as the <hi>Inner Court,</hi> into which come a better ſort of divine gifts; this is ennobled with <hi>knowledge, prudence, &amp;c.</hi> and other habits of intellectual and moral vertues. But <hi>the ſoul</hi> conſidered in the capacity (before expreſſed) as a ſpiritual, immortal ſubſtance, is that part of man into which the Holy Ghoſt entreth, and which is as it were his throne: Here the fear of the Lord reſideth, and maketh it truly excellent. I ſhall now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my ſecond demonſtration; <hi>That is the moſt excellent quality, which ennobleth the moſt excellent part, and that in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent capacity; and that is the moſt excellent perſon whoſe better and more excellent part is ſo ennobled and made excellent. But the fear of the Lord ennobleth the more noble and excellent part, and that in the nobleſt and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent capacity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The truth of the Propoſition will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> appear, if we conſider <hi>the excellency of the object, to which this excellent quality moveth the ſoul, and for an union with which it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth it.</hi> The force of the demonſtration dependeth upon the principle, <hi>That the more excellent any object is towards an union, with which any quality is ſubſervient, and working, the more excellent that habit or quality is:</hi> which is a principle ſo juſtifiable to reaſon, and allowed by common conſent and judgement,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43194:46"/> that I need not inſiſt on the proof of it. Take all other qualities or advantages which the creature can afford, they ſerve us no further than to the creature, preparing us for an union with that. For inſtance, <hi>Beauty</hi> is an amiable gift of God; but wherein doth it ſerve us? it indeed may commend the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to an husband; but it will not at all commend her to Chriſt. <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> are <hi>rare habits,</hi> and prepare us for an union, and endearment to, and with wiſe and learned men; but they commend not a ſoul at all unto God. The like may be ſaid of thoſe other diſtinguiſhing excellencies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned. But now this excellent habit, <hi>The fear of the Lord,</hi> commendeth the ſoul to the Creator, and prepares it for a glorious union with him who is the ſupreme good, and unqueſtionably the moſt excellent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The beautiful, the knowing, the wiſe perſon may be abominable to God; a child of wrath, and abhorred by him; but in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation, <hi>he that feareth God and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted of him</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle.) Reaſon teacheth us to judge thoſe the moſt excellent perſons in the world, who upon a juſt account are moſt approvable to the wiſeſt and moſt excellent perſons of the earth, and thoſe things the moſt excellent which render any ſo acceptable upon this account (if there were no other, we ſhould ſet a great rate upon <hi>knowledge, vertue</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> above what we ſet upon beauty, and riches, and bodily ſtrength, &amp;c. becauſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43194:47"/> they commend us to the more judicious, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and wiſer part of the world. By the like parity of reaſon (certainly) if we will but uſe our reaſon, and accordingly form our judgement, we muſt judge <hi>the fear of the Lord</hi> the moſt excellent quality; and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who feareth the Lord, the moſt excellent perſon; he alone is the <hi>Jedidiah,</hi> the perſon whom God loveth, the ſoul whom God careth for. This, and this alone is that which commendeth the Creature to the Creator.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>That is the moſt excellent quality</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                     <hi>which directeth to, and prepareth the ſoul for the moſt excellent end.</hi> There is an end to which the wiſe Creator hath ordained and deſigned every thing which he hath made: and there is an end which every rational agent propoundeth to it ſelf in working: and there is an end or iſſue, which every thing will have. The great end of man in point of action, for which God hath created him, is <hi>the glorifying of his holy Name.</hi> The wiſe man ſaith, <hi>God made all things for himſelf.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>For him are all things.</hi> God in working, worked for the beſt ends, cauſe he could work <hi>for no greater,</hi> wrought for himſelf. The Apoſtle ſaith of man parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, <hi>We are created in Chriſt Jeſus unto</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>good works, which God had before ordained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> Mans great end in point of fruition and priviledge, is the <hi>enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God here,</hi> in the <hi>influences of grace;</hi> hereafter in the <hi>beatifical viſion</hi> of his glory.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43194:47"/> There now are the great ends of man; the ends for which God hath created him, and which the wiſer ſort of men will propound to themſelves. Beſides theſe great ends of man, there are alſo ſome <hi>little ends</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions to which men direct much of their action; ſuch as the obtaining of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable beeing and ſubſiſtence in this life, &amp;c. An end (though in it ſelf conſiderable) yet exceeding little in compariſon with the former, as every one will judge who hath but learned to compare <hi>Time</hi> with <hi>Eternity,</hi> and the ſoul with the body, and outward man. Take now all thoſe other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, as things either in reality, or vulgar eſtimation, raiſing the price of one mortal above another (this only excepted) the higheſt end they move towards, which they diſpoſe and prepare the creature for, is no more than a ſweet and happy beeing in this life, and that too, according to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humours of men; as one fancieth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to lie in riches; a ſecond, in pleaſure; a third in intellectual, or moral virtue. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſtrength and health are great bleſſings of God; but what further fruit do they bring forth, than what taſts well to a mortal pallat? what do they ſignifie more, than that ſuch as are bleſſed with them, paſs the time of their mortality with leſs pain, ſorrow and trouble, than thoſe that want them? <hi>Beauty</hi> is an amiable gift; but hath it any further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon mans felicity than this, that whoſe are bleſſed with it, ſtand in a nearer
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43194:48"/> capacity to ſome creatures favour than others, more deformed and uncomely, to whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united by marriage, or ſome near degrees of affection, they ſhall (probably) in the world have a life of more content, pleaſure, and outward ſatisfaction, than others who are not under ſo lovely circumſtances. Come from them to the indowments of the mind; <hi>knowledge, prudence, a diligent, induſtrious, or active ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi> and indeed what ever elſe can be named (this fear of the Lord only excepted) they neither direct the ſoul to its beſt and nobleſt end; nor any way prepare and diſpoſe it for the obtaining of it unleſs in a very remote capacity. What's the iſſue of <hi>knowledge, wiſdom,</hi> but this, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thus far bleſſed, ſtand upon better ground to live in the world than other men, as well in regard of the ſatisfaction theſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits give to the mind, as of the light that ariſeth from them to direct a mans converſe, and the uſefulneſs of ſuch a perſon unto others. The ſame might be ſaid of moral vertues, <hi>Riches, Honours, great Relations, &amp;c.</hi> They none of them look beyond this life, nor contribute any thing to an happineſs beyond it. Nay, it were yet ſomething, if they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly bleſſed a man, ſo long as he is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeribed with the limits of time and mortality; but how little do they, if I ſhall evidence they come ſhort of this? than which there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of more eaſie demonſtration. For to us who are Chriſtians, there's ſomething more required even to ſuch an happineſs, than an
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43194:48"/> 
                     <hi>affluence of worldly contentments.</hi> We know and believe that there is a God, that this God is the chiefeſt good, and conſequently (build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the rational principle of all Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers) we conclude that happineſs even on this ſide of Heaven, muſt lie in the enjoyment of this God; having an intereſt and portion in him; nor can any aſſent to principles of reaſon above Atheiſm, but his reaſon will inforce his ſubſcription to this; for if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves there is a God, he muſt acknowledge him ſupremely good; and his reaſon will tell him, happineſs muſt needs lie in an union with the higheſt good. The Heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers indeed, having not the light of divine revelation, according to their various hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours (not knowing of any poſſibility of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying God) judged <hi>pleaſures, riches, honours, knowledge, vertue,</hi> to be <hi>the greateſt good,</hi> and conſequently mans happineſs to lie in the fruition of them. But we, though our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſhare in reaſon with them, enforceth us to agree with them in that main principle, <hi>That mans chiefeſt happineſs muſt neceſſary lie in his union to, and fruition of the greateſt good.</hi> Yet being further enlightened, cannot agree with their notion of that good; for although they had their dark notions of a divine beeing, yet the poſſibility of a creatures union with God through Chriſt, Gods in-dwelling in the ſoul, the having of God for their God, reconciled in Chriſt, were things which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plate</hi> never dreamt of: But we having, by the light of the divine Spirit, made theſe diſcoveries,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43194:49"/> even their reaſonable principle, enforceth us to conclude, <hi>That the higheſt enjoyments and happineſs of man even in this life, muſt needs be his union with, and enjoyment of God.</hi> His being made partaker of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and <hi>transformation into the Divine Image.</hi> So that all thoſe other things do not reach ſo much as this end, the happy beeing of a man in this life; for we all know it is poſſible that men and women may have <hi>ſtrength, beauty, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, prudence, wit, great relations, riches, honours, &amp;c.</hi> and yet enjoy nothing of God, but be at infinite diſtance from him, whom we acknowledge the ſupreme and chiefeſt good. But now this excellent habit, <hi>The fear of the Lord,</hi> doth both evidence our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent union with God, and his ſpecial favour to us; and alſo it worketh us up to further degrees of union and communion with him.</p>
                  <p>But further yet, we who are Chriſtians, are taught to look beyond this life, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our ſelves as <hi>creatures under an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a certain Eternity,</hi> either <hi>in happineſs</hi> or <hi>miſery.</hi> We know that our ſouls are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſubſtances; and will not, as the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſouls of beaſts when they die, evaporate into air: Hence we are concerned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider wherein the happineſs of a ſoul in its ſtate of ſeparation lyes; and believing the Scriptures, we cannot but believe that even <hi>theſe immortal bodies</hi> ſhall in the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> put upon <hi>immortality,</hi> theſe <hi>corruptibles incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> and ſo are concerned further to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43194:49"/> inquire wherein the happineſs of the ſoul and body lies in its ſtate of reunion. Here again we cannot but with the Philoſophers agree, that it muſt needs lie in an union with, and an enjoyment of the beſt and chiefeſt good, which the holy Scripture calleth, <hi>A ſeeing of God as he is; knowing him as we are known; being ever with the Lord:</hi> In one word, <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</hi> This now our reaſon naturally work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Scripture hypotheſes, inforceth us to believe: and that this is the nobleſt and higheſt end of man as to priviledge, to which it is but reaſonable that he who knoweth it, ſhould direct all his actions. Now let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider all thoſe other pretty things, and ſee what they ſignifie with relation to this end. The ſtrong man, the beautiful woman, the knowing, the prudent and politick perſon, may all of them go to Hell: the morally ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perſon may be for ever excluded the Kingdom of God (that <hi>righteouſneſs exceedeth not the righteouſneſs of Scribes and Phariſees.)</hi> The Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26. ſpeaking of thoſe whom God hath choſen, ſaith, <hi>Not many noble; not many wiſe after the fleſh; not many mighty; but God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe. The poor of this world hath God choſen,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James.</hi> Could you look into the black dungeon of infernal ſpirits, where miſerable ſouls are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in chains, unto the further judgement of the great and terrible day, you would ſee there many a <hi>Goliah,</hi> whoſe ſtrength could not reſcue him from the potent arm of divine
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43194:50"/> Juſtice. Many a <hi>Thais,</hi> whoſe beauty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of commending her to thoſe eyes (which ſee not as man ſees) rather betrayed her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that miſerable pit. Many a Prince and Emperour, who knew not God, nor obeyed the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus. Many a cunning <hi>Achitophel,</hi> whom God took in his craftineſs. Many an ingenuous Atheiſt; many a rich <hi>Dives;</hi> but amongſt them all, you would not find one ſingle man or woman, that in this life feared the Lord. No, <hi>Prov. 3. 18. Wiſdom is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her.</hi> All thoſe other notes of diſtinction make ſome difference betwixt one creature and another as to this life; but as to the nobleſt and higheſt end of man, the bleſſed and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py enjoyment of God to all eternity; nothing but grace, nothing but the fear of the Lord makes any difference at all; without this, all perſons, noble and baſe, rich and poor, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful or deformed, knowing or ignorant, witty or heavy, prudent or fooliſh, vertuous or vitious, will go to the ſame place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This therefore muſt be the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent habit; and the perſon poſſeſſed with it, the moſt excellent perſon, becauſe leading to, and prepared for the moſt noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent end.</p>
                  <p>Again, the fear of the Lord will appear to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> be the moſt excellent thing, and the perſon poſſeſſed of it, to be the moſt excellent perſon; if we conſider <hi>thoſe noble actions to which the ſoul is by this principled.</hi> Humane actions are ordinarily divided unto ſuch as are <hi>natural;</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:43194:50"/> ſuch as <hi>eating, drinking, &amp;c. moral, and civil, or political,</hi> ſuch are the works of our callings, giving to every one their due, living ſoberly and temperately, &amp;c. and <hi>ſuch as are Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi> which are our actions of homage to God: of theſe now the ſecond are more noble than the firſt; and the laſt the nobleſt of all. Again, as to our religious actions, they are either more imperfectly, or more perfectly ſuch. I call thoſe more imperfectly ſuch, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are ſo <hi>as to the matter of the act,</hi> but not <hi>as to the manner or form of the performance;</hi> ſo <hi>prayer, hearing the Word of God, &amp;c.</hi> But theſe are not ſo in a perfect and true notion, unleſs performed from a due principle, in a due manner, and to that due end which God hath commanded. Now thoſe are our moſt noble and perfect actions, which are religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the moſt proper and perfect ſenſe; and to thoſe, this excellent quality; <hi>The fear of the Lord</hi> principleth the ſoul. Others do but diſpoſe and fit the body or mind for <hi>natural or moral actions, ſtrength, bodily activity</hi> do no more, no more do <hi>knowledge, prudence,</hi> or the <hi>habits</hi> of moral vertues; or if ſome of thoſe other things do diſpoſe and principle any to religious actions; yet it is but to ſuch actions more imperfectly conſidered. It is true, knowledge is an excellent thing, and hath its uſe, not only in fitting a man for greater perfections in natural and civil actions, but alſo for religious ſervices; it prepareth men for prayer, hearing the Word, &amp;c. and the habits of <hi>moral vertues</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:43194:51"/> prepare men for <hi>vertuous actions</hi> commanded in the word of God, and which are to be performed in obedience to the command of God; but now <hi>Grace,</hi> the fear of the Lord diſpoſeth, and prepareth the ſoul for the moſt perfect <hi>performance of religious duties;</hi> ſuch as are truly religious in all circumſtances, ſo as they ſhall be acceptable unto God. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one who <hi>giveth to the poor,</hi> or <hi>doth a juſt action,</hi> doth not that which is acceptable to God; but he alone who doth thoſe things from a <hi>principle of faith,</hi> or <hi>in the fear of God,</hi> and <hi>in obedience unto God,</hi> doth that which God accepteth. So ſaith <hi>Peter, In every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he that feareth God, and worketh righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, is accepted of him.</hi> Every one that worketh righteouſneſs, from <hi>the fear of the Lord,</hi> principling his ſoul to ſuch righteous acts, is accepted of God. So as this fear of the Lord upon this account, is the moſt noble and <hi>excellent habit,</hi> as it principleth the ſoul to its moſt noble acts, and to the trueſt and moſt perfect performance of them; being that without which (as the principle) it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible a ſoul in its higheſt acts of devotion ſhould pleaſe God. The <hi>vertuous actions</hi> of men; yea, the <hi>religious actions</hi> of formaliſts devoid of this principle, are no better than <hi>ſplendid ſins</hi> (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> called the moral of the Heathens) ſo that by the ſame reaſon that we judge, <hi>knowledge, prudence,</hi> or any other intellectual or moral habits, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than other <hi>ornaments</hi> of a man, as ſitting and diſpoſing perſons for more noble
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43194:51"/> and brave actions. We muſt alſo judge <hi>The fear of the Lord</hi> more excellent than them all, becauſe it further ennobleth the ſoul, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring and diſpoſing it yet to and for more brave and excellent acts, as ſuch whereby we moſt anſwer the end of our creation in glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of God, and wherein, or in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of which in ſuch manner as this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth, we are acceptable unto God.</p>
                  <p>6. But let us further conſider this noble and excellent quality, <hi>in the aſpect which it hath upon us,</hi> not only in the performance of our duty to God, under which reſpect we have already conſidered it; but <hi>in the influence which it hath upon us</hi> in our civil and political converſe with men. <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 16. 3. calleth <hi>the Saints which are in the earth the excellent.</hi> Indeed they are ſo, and that not only as <hi>Saints,</hi> as <hi>perſons</hi> prepared for God (as the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> tranſlated Saints in that place ſeems to import) but alſo upon a rational view, and a truly civil and political conſideration. Perſons <hi>fearing the Lord,</hi> have not only the beſt ſouls, and are not only beſt conſidered in themſelves, and in reference to God, but they are alſo the <hi>beſt neighbours.</hi> This will appear to you upon the digeſting theſe two conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Word of God conſidered as a ſyſteme of precepts fitted for the maintaining of humane ſociety, is the moſt excellent body of ſuch political precepts, with all poſſible advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of comfort to ſuch as are engaged as c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> relates in ſuch ſocieties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:43194:52"/>2. Secondly, (which I told you in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubject of the Propoſition) <hi>That the perſon fearing the Lord, is a perſon who having the dread of God upon his heart, exerciſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a ſtrict obſervance of the Divine Law, in all things to keep a good conſcience both towards God and towards man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The firſt is a moſt demonſtrable truth; take all the Laws of the wiſeſt Nations and Law-givers that ever were in the world, pick out the beſt of thoſe of the <hi>twelve tables at Rome,</hi> amend what is deficient there by thoſe of <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Licurgus,</hi> refuſe <hi>Juſtinians Code.</hi> Search all the bodies of Laws in the world, and out of them all make one <hi>Syſteme,</hi> one <hi>body</hi> of political and domeſtick precepts; it will not prove ſo fitted for the comfortable and advantageous living in humane ſociety, as the Law of the Lord contained in the holy Scriptures is. I durſt appeal to the reaſon of a <hi>Cato</hi> or <hi>Ariſtides</hi> in the caſe. Let but any perſon out of the Book of God, draw out thoſe precepts which it hath given concerning Magiſtrates and Subjects, <hi>Husbands and Wives, Parents and Children, Maſters and Servants,</hi> or any political <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Then let him but ſuppoſe ſuch a City in the world, where within doors, all Parents and Children, all Maſters and Servants, all Husbands and Wives lived exactly according to thoſe Rules, and <hi>without doors;</hi> the Publick Magiſtrates, and the people governed by them, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and their reſpective flocks, neighbours and friends, behaved themſelves each to other
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43194:52"/> according to thoſe preſcriptions, and let him fancy if he can; and ſoberly tell me if he can, what could be wanting, to the beauty, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and comfortable living of ſuch a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. So true in this caſe alſo is that of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal. 19. 7, 8. The Law of the Lord is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The Statutes of the Lord are right.</hi> It were eaſie to demonſtrate this in particular, were it not too large a digreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſay in the ſecond place, <hi>That a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon fearing the Lord, is one who doth exerciſe himſelf in this, in a ſtrict obſervance of the Divine Law, to keep a conſcience void of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, both towards God, and towards men.</hi> Whence it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the fear of the Lord is the moſt excellent quality, and the perſon fearing the Lord the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perſon, conſidered in a political, as well as a religious capacity. The beſt neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, husband, wife, parent, child, &amp;c. as well as the beſt Chriſtian. Let us but uſe our reaſon a little. Is not that man or woman beſt prepared to, and fitted for humane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, who is <hi>under the higheſt obligations ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, To do no kind of wrong to another; To give to every one his due, and that in every capacity, and as he hath occaſion; even to his enemies, and to the worſt of men, without any reſpect to his particular prejudices, to do all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible good;</hi> and who accordingly ſo liveth, ſo walketh? The perſon fearing God,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>As to theſe things is under the higheſt imaginable obligations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Thus he walketh, thus in a great meaſure</hi>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:43194:53"/> 
                     <hi>he liveth,</hi> giving ſtill allowance to humane infirmities.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay firſt, he is as to theſe things <hi>under the higheſt imaginable obligations.</hi> This will be evident to you, if you will conſider, that the Law of the Lord (which he owneth as his only Rule) requireth theſe things at his hands, that this Law is not only in his eye, but in his heart; that he ſtands obliged to the performance of it, under the fear of the greateſt terrours (ſuch the terrours of the Lord are) and under the incouragement of the largeſt promiſes, and upon the higheſt principles of ingenuity. A man or woman not fearing God, may be under obligations <hi>to do no man wrong; to give to every one his due; to do good to others, &amp;c.</hi> But I pray, what are his obligations? Let us weigh them apart, and conſider them with the obligations to the ſame things, which are upon the hearts of perſons fearing the Lord; and who have in them this ſame principle.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Others may be under <hi>the obligations of humane Laws;</hi> and bleſſed be God for them; to them we are beholden, that there are in the world no more <hi>murthers, thefts,</hi> and other <hi>diſorders,</hi> to the utter confuſion of humane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. Men are afraid of the Ax, the Gallows, &amp;c. But alas! what is the force of theſe, compared with the terrour of <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?</hi> If he be under an obligation to avoid theſe enormous diſorders in <hi>humane ſociety,</hi> who is only awed from them with the fear
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43194:53"/> of a <hi>Gaol</hi> or <hi>Gallows?</hi> what is he, think you, who is afraid of being tormented in <hi>Hell</hi> by the wrath of God to all eternity? <hi>Where the worm never dieth, and the fire never goeth out?</hi> It is true, there is the ſame obligation upon him that <hi>feareth not God;</hi> he is in danger of Hell fire; but it is the perſon <hi>fearing God</hi> who alone firmly and fixedly believeth any ſuch thing. Others, if they do not laugh and mock at ſuch things; yet very faintly aſſent to Propoſitions of ſuch a nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Obligations may lie upon others to juſt and vertuous actions, <hi>from the rational beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and comelineſs of a juſt and ſober converſation, above one which is lewd and debaucht.</hi> Until reaſon in man be out-lawed, and beaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and affections have perfectly ſubdued it, moral vertue will commend it ſelf to humane nature. But what is the force of this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, compared with the <hi>Will of God</hi> to that man, who hath ſaid, the Lord ſhall <hi>rule over him?</hi> Or to the apprehenſion of a <hi>Conformity</hi> (by ſuch actions) to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to him to whom Chriſt is precious, who hath avowed Chriſt to be his Maſter, and aſſumed to be his Diſciple. What is this obligation to the conſideration of a gracious man, that theſe are the <hi>fruits of the Spirit</hi> which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and in which he ſtandeth obliged to walk, and that the contrary acts are the <hi>fruits of the fleſh,</hi> which he ſtandeth obliged to <hi>mortifie:</hi> which if he ſo much as <hi>ſavours,</hi> they will argue him <hi>to walk after the fleſh,</hi> and conclude him liable to condemnation,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43194:54"/> as having no intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt. The <hi>gracious man</hi> does not theſe things, becauſe reaſon only approves them; but becauſe <hi>God hath commanded,</hi> and becauſe <hi>God doth approve</hi> them, becauſe they are the Will of God concerning him, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt (while in the fleſh) <hi>ſo walked, ſetting him an an example, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Others may have obligations upon them, to do ſome ſuch things from <hi>good nature.</hi> Some naturally are of more ſweet and ingenuous natures than others are; more naturally inclined to <hi>juſtice, pitty, mercy;</hi> and this obligation worketh very high where it is found. But alas! what is this to his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, who hath theſe things as branches of the Law of God ingraven upon his heart, and that in that deep ſculpture which the finger of the holy Spirit uſeth to make? to his who hath a <hi>new name,</hi> yea and a new nature given to him; and from that new nature, acts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſcript of <hi>Divine Law freely and ingenuouſly,</hi> not from conſtraint. <hi>Luther</hi> ſometimes ſaid of ſuch a one, <hi>Juſtus non debet bene agere, ſed bene agit.</hi> A paſſage that had need of a candid interpretation; but thus far true, That a man or woman truly <hi>fearing God,</hi> is not ſo much conſtrained by the force of a Divine Law (in which ſenſe it may be the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>the Law is not made for him)</hi> as compelled by his <hi>new nature,</hi> and the generous principles of the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; his nature is quite altered; the things which he hated, he now loveth; and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43194:54"/> what he formerly loved, he now abhorreth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Again, a man or woman not fearing God, may be under ſome obligations to juſt and vertuous actions, which may make him a good neighbour. From <hi>Honour,</hi> obedience to Governours, <hi>Courteſie</hi> to ſome who have done him a kindneſs; or an ingenuous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abhorring to do wrong to ſuch as have done him none. But alas! what are theſe, compared with the <hi>honour</hi> of maintaining the repute of a Chriſtian, of a child of God, who is concerned to walk unblameably, as a Spouſe of Chriſt, which muſt be preſented <hi>without ſpot and wrinckle,</hi> who is preſſed to theſe actions from a far higher ingagement upon his <hi>ingenuity,</hi> as they are the preſcripts of that God, who hath loved him with an everlaſting love; of that dear Saviour, who hath not loved his life for his ſake. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>muſt love mine enemies; do good to them that hate me; bleſs them that perſecute me; and pray for them who deſpitefully uſe me.</hi> Thus I ſhall be <hi>like my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Thus I ſhall fulfil the <hi>Royal Law of Love,</hi> under which my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath laid me. I cannot ſay, <hi>I love him, if I do not keep his Commandments.</hi>

The fear of the Lord ſtill remains moſt excellent; the moſt excellent principle of <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical actions;</hi> and whoſo truly feareth the Lord, is, and according to all true principles of reaſon muſt be concluded, even as to theſe things, to be the moſt excellent perſon, <hi>Do this and live</hi> (ſaith <hi>Joſeph) for I fear God.</hi> I durſt not abuſe you; I dare do you no wrong, for I fear God; and though this were ſufficient to have ſaid, yet conſidering what advantage the peeviſh world hath alwaies taken from the miſcarriages of individual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to charge profeſſion at large; I ſhall but offer this further demonſtration for the ſtopping of every mouth.

Certain it is, that it is a meer air, and in reality juſt nothing; that which is often gained by fordid perſons, which neither betters the man, as to his body, mind, nor ſoul; only ſerveth him as to a comfortable ſubſiſtence in this life, and gains him the wall, a cap and a knee, and a title. Take <hi>Riches,</hi> another thing which in vulgar opinion carries with it a great notion of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and imprinteth upon man a conſiderable difference from his neighbour: They make a fair ſhew, and have a great appearance; hence whoſo hath them, ſwells in the opinion of himſelf, and all he world does him homage.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43194:61"/> But what is <hi>ſilver</hi> and <hi>gold</hi> in reality? What is gold more than <hi>yellow ſand?</hi> and ſilver more than <hi>white earth,</hi> conſidered in it ſelf, without the relative value which men put upon it? Indeed more (by far) is to be ſaid for the inward habits of the mind; <hi>Knowledge, Prudence, Sobriety,</hi> and the reſt of the moral vertues; but neither are they without their vanity, as I ſhall ſhew you anon. I ſhall add no more to this firſt thing, demonſtrating the vanity and emptineſs of ſuch other things, as inhance the price of one man above another. They are a great deal more in appearance, than they are in reality.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing which I inſtanced in, was this, <hi>They are ſuch as never fill or ſatisfie the mind of the perſon poſſeſſed of them,</hi> like dreams of feaſts, notwithſtanding which, we are hungry; <hi>lyes</hi> in our <hi>right hand;</hi> like wind in the body, which often filleth the ſtomach, and ſpoileth the appetite to its proper food, but never nouriſheth the body, nor ſatisfieth the hunger. I ſhall ſhew,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That they will not ſatisfie the wants of the ſoul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That they leſs ſatisfie the ſouls expectation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay firſt, <hi>They will not ſatisfie the ſouls wants.</hi> The true wants of the reaſonable ſoul, are, and can be ſatisfied with nothing but <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influences.</hi> It is a <hi>noble ſpirit;</hi> and none but the <hi>Father of ſpirits</hi> can fill its emptineſs. The ſoul while it ſleeps in the <hi>Lethargy</hi> of ſin, while it ſojourneth in its eſtate of eſtrangement from God (like the Prodigal)
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43194:61"/> it feedeth Swine, and filleth its belly with the husks; but after it hath once fixed its reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to return to its <hi>Fathers houſe,</hi> nothing leſs than God can fill it; it cries out (as once <hi>Rachel</hi> for children) <hi>Lord give me Chriſt or elſe I die.</hi> It is plainly impoſſible that any thing but the favour of God, and the ſenſe of that favour, or at leaſt <hi>good hopes</hi> of it through grace ſhould ever ſatisfie that ſoul, that is once awakened to conſider its ſelf (as in its <hi>natural conſtitution)</hi> a ſpiritual, immortal being, ordained to an Eternity: and as it is (in its <hi>depraved eſtate)</hi> by nature <hi>a child of wrath.</hi> I ſay again, the ſoul thus reflecting upon it ſelf, can be ſatisfied with nothing leſs than the ſenſe, or firm hopes of Gods favour, making over the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt</hi> unto it, and accepting it as righteous in and through Chriſt; and whatſoever ſoul is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied without this, is either ignorant of its own ſtate and capacity, or exceeding vain and careleſs, not regarding its higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. As <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God bid him <hi>ask what he would, and he would give it him,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>What canſt thou give me, whiles I go childleſs?</hi> So the awakened ſoul ſaith, <hi>What can God give me whiles I go childleſs? Beauty</hi> is a pretty thing; but what is it to Eternity? <hi>Riches</hi> are uſeful things, but they will not ranſom my ſoul from the pit of Hell. <hi>Honour</hi> will ſerve me to take a place or the wall in this world; but it will not give me a <hi>place</hi> at Gods right hand. <hi>Pleaſure</hi> is a ſweet thing, oh! but <hi>endleſs torments</hi> will be a dreadful
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43194:62"/> iſſue of it. <hi>Great Friends and Relations</hi> are great <hi>bleſſings;</hi> but it is Chriſt alone can ſtand my friend in the Court of Heaven, to ſpeak for me, that I may not be ſent unto eternal burnings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as nothing but divine influences will ſatisfie the <hi>ſouls wants:</hi> ſo nothing elſe <hi>will ſatisfie the ſouls expectation.</hi> The wiſe man, who had as great experience as any mortal man ever had, cries out; <hi>The eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing,</hi> nor <hi>the ear with hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> The ſoul never cries, <hi>enough Lord,</hi> till Chriſt be to it <hi>all in all.</hi> Every thing (the fear of the Lord only excepted) <hi>is like the graſs on the houſe tops, with which the mower filleth not his hand: nor be that gathereth ſheaves his arm.</hi> What vain woman was ever ſatisfied with beauty? or what vainer worldling had his expectation ever ſatisfied with the returns of gold and ſilver? who was ever ſatisfied with honour, or the favour of men? what ſtudent was ever filled with knowledge? Poor vain man looketh upon theſe things at a diſtance, and expecteth much from them, and promiſeth himſelf reſt and content in them: But though God hath given man many outward bleſſings; yet he hath excepted the <hi>Reſt of the mind</hi> from them. Hence man thinks, could I but arrive at ſuch an eſtate, at ſuch a degree of <hi>honour, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> then I ſhould be ſatisfied; but alas! he findeth that he is but like the ſick perſon, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ncieth firſt one thing, then another, to pleaſe his pallat, and give him reſt, which
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43194:62"/> when he hath tried, anſwereth not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation he had upon it. The more a man hath of theſe things, the more he ſtill would have; are they not then deceitful? are they any thing better than a lye? But hath now <hi>the fear of the Lord</hi> any ſuch vanity attending it? ſurely no. <hi>I have learned</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) in all eſtates to be content; content to want, content to abound, &amp;c.</hi> It is true, till a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian be in Heaven, he never hath ſo much of <hi>divine influence,</hi> as he deſireth no more. There is a ſpiritual thirſt which will never be quenched, but by the <hi>Rivers of pleaſure,</hi> that <hi>water the coeleſtial Paradiſe.</hi> But yet <hi>grace,</hi> as it leadeth to a fulneſs of ſatisfaction; ſo it preſently poſſeſſeth the ſoul of a proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſatisfaction; ſo as it ſaith to all the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Dives</hi> of the world (as <hi>Eſau</hi> to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob) I have enough my Brother, I have enough; keep what thou haſt unto thy ſelf. Diogenes</hi> never undervalued <hi>Alexanders</hi> great offers, with ſo true an heart, as the ſoul poſſeſſed with it, undervalueth the whole Creation. Nor doth this ever fail <hi>the ſouls expectation.</hi> Every gracious ſoul is ſo far from finding any fruſtration in its expectations, from the enjoyments of God, that (as the <hi>Queen of Sheba</hi> to <hi>Solomon)</hi> it confeſſeth, that the half of <hi>that ſweetneſs and content</hi> in the <hi>holy waies of God,</hi> which it hath met with ſince it turned into them, <hi>was never told unto it.</hi> But this is enough to have ſpoken to the ſecond thing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>Many of thoſe other things</hi>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:43194:63"/> which I mentioned, <hi>are moſt dangerous ſnares and traps to the poor creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall open this general unto you by ſhewing you,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That thoſe other excellencies are often occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to ſouls of great ſinnings againſt God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That many of them expoſe the perſon that hath them to great dangers and ſuffering; which the ſweetneſs and good of them can in no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure compenſate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay firſt, <hi>divers</hi> (if not all of them) <hi>are occaſions of great ſinnings to the ſoul that is (ſeemingly) bleſſed with them.</hi> And this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a very great vanity. Here I might enter into a large diſcourſe, ſhewing you what <hi>ſnares</hi> and <hi>temptations to ſin</hi> lie in <hi>Beauty, Wiſdom</hi> (worldly wiſdom I mean) <hi>Riches, Honours, &amp;c.</hi> In ſhort, in all thoſe other things which I mentioned (the fear of the Lord alone excepted) by which one man is in the <hi>way</hi> of excellency diſtinguiſhed from his neighbour.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. More generally, <hi>They are all of them great occaſions to men, to think of themſelves above what they ought to think</hi> (which is the Apoſtles <hi>Periphraſis</hi> of Pride.) There is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in us all a propenſion to <hi>Pride.</hi> Now that corruption wants an <hi>hill</hi> for to ſtand and ſhew it ſelf upon, until a man hath diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or at leaſt ſancieth that he hath diſcovered, in himſelf ſomething in which he excelleth another; which being once diſcovered, he thinks he hath warrant enough to vaunt himſelf, and to be a ſelf-admirer, to ſcorn,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43194:63"/> ſlight and undervalue others (how worthy ſoever) if they be not, or he judgeth that they are not equal with him, in that particular thing wherein he ſancieth his own excellency. But beſides this ſnare which lieth in them all, there is ſcarce any of them but hath a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſnare in it, if not more than one. <hi>Beauty</hi> is an occaſion to <hi>chambering and wantonneſs. Knowledge</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle) puffeth up. World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prudence</hi> too too ordinarily exalteth the ſoul above the wiſdom which is from God; whence the Apoſtle adviſeth men to <hi>become fools, that they may be wiſe. Riches, honour,</hi> and <hi>favour of men,</hi> are uſual temptations to <hi>pride, luxury, oppreſſion of others, &amp;c. Prov. 18. 23. The poor uſeth intreaties, but the rich anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth roughly, Micah 6. 12. The rich are full of violence.</hi> Upon which, as well as upon other accounts it is that our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth. 9. 23. That it is eaſier for a Camel to go thorow the eye of a Needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God. Do not rich men oppreſs you?</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>James</hi> 2. 6.) It would ask me a great deal of time at large to diſcourſe to you the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſnares for the ſoul, which lie hid in all thoſe creature excellencies which I have inſtanced in. But now in this <hi>fear of the Lord,</hi> there's nothing of this danger. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> telleth us, <hi>That the fear of the Lord is to depart from iniquity.</hi> So <hi>Job, chap. 28. v. 28. The fear of the Lord, that is wiſdom; and to depart from evil, that is underſtanding.</hi> So that we may ſay of <hi>the fear of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:43194:64"/> ſpeaks of the man made rich by the <hi>bleſſing of the Lord. The bleſſing of the Lord maketh rich, and addeth no ſorrow with it.</hi> Other things give a man ſome ſhadow of happineſs in this life; but there is <hi>ſorrow</hi> added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; and oft-times they do <hi>ten thouſand times</hi> more harm to the ſoul, than good to the outward man. But now <hi>the fear of the Lord</hi> is a <hi>Roſe</hi> without a <hi>prickle;</hi> it maketh the ſoul of a man happy, and addeth no ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row therewith. Inſtead of expoſing the ſoul to temptation, it armeth the ſoul againſt all temptations to ſin againſt God. Amongſt all other excellencies, one would think the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of moral vertues</hi> ſhould be moſt free from this vanity; yet even they have in them a moſt dangerous ſnare. The perſon <hi>morally righteous,</hi> being very apt to raiſe up to himſelf <hi>a confidence in the fleſh,</hi> and to deſpiſe the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> which (as the Apoſtle ſaith) is revealed <hi>from faith to faith.</hi> Upon <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 17.</note> this very account it was, that <hi>Saul</hi> (when Chriſt was diſcovered to him) judged <hi>thoſe things loſs, which he once accounted gain, Phil. 3. 7. But what things were gain to me, thoſe I counted loſs for Chriſt.</hi> What theſe things were, he telleth you, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6. One was, <hi>[touching the righteouſneſs which is of the Law blameleſs.]</hi> How was this loſs to him, but as his pron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>neſs to reſt in that as ſufficient, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him from accepting of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God revealed from <hi>faith to faith.</hi> This very thing kept the Jews from <hi>ſubmitting to the Righteouſneſs of God.</hi> This made our
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43194:64"/> Saviour tell the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and <hi>other Jews,</hi> that <hi>Publicans and Harlots ſhould enter into the Kingdom of God, but the children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould be coſt out.</hi> Now in the <hi>fear of the Lord</hi> there is no ſnare; it keepeth the ſoul from ſin, but no way expoſeth the ſoul to ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Thoſe other diſtinctive excellencies, are great ſnares, as they expoſe the perſon poſſeſſed of them, to great ſuffering, and give him no ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and comfort in ſuffering.</hi> Theſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which uſually attend thoſe other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, flow from the <hi>envy, malice, jealouſie, covetouſneſs</hi> or <hi>ambition</hi> of others. If a man or woman excel their neighbour in <hi>riches, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, knowledge, honour, &amp;c.</hi> they preſently become the objects of their <hi>envy</hi> and <hi>hatred:</hi> this ariſeth from the <hi>pride</hi> of our fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that will not allow them patience to be excelled. It were endleſs to tell you, what ſome mens <hi>riches,</hi> and <hi>honours,</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of men,</hi> have <hi>coſt;</hi> and what <hi>beauty</hi> hath coſt others; and what is moſt ſad. Their ſufferings afford them no ſatisfaction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to their ſmart; they under them bear the whole weight of their croſs with their own ſhoulders. It is true <hi>the fear of the Lord</hi> too doth not indemnifie the perſons poſſeſſed with it, from trials of <hi>ſcourgings,</hi> and <hi>cruel mockings;</hi> no not from the <hi>fiery trial,</hi> which the Apoſtle would not have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers think <hi>ſtrange.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had both <hi>troubles without,</hi> and <hi>fears within.</hi> And it was ſaid of old, <hi>That he who departeth</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:43194:65"/> 
                     <hi>from evil, maketh himſelf a prey.</hi> Which is a ſentence verifieth it ſelf ſtill, and will hold ſo long as there is a <hi>World</hi> to <hi>hate us,</hi> which hated Chriſt firſt <hi>(And the Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the Servant above his Lord)</hi> or any of the <hi>ſeed of the Serpent in the world,</hi> which will be <hi>till our Lord hath trodden all his enemies under his feet.</hi> But as uſually the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Gods people on this ſingle account, are not proportionable to thoſe others men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: ſo neither are they without ſuch a proportionable comfort and ſatisfaction, as makes them indeed no ſufferings to them. The Martyrs <hi>fire</hi> is become <hi>a bed of Roſes. The ſufferings of this life not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the glory to be revealed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth thing which evineeth the <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>deceitfulneſs</hi> of thoſe other excellenciet, is, <hi>their ſubjection to viciſſitudes and changes.</hi> I take this to be a principle adjudged by reaſon; <hi>That ſuppoſing a thing to have in it ſome grains of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; yet if it be ſubject to diminution, putrifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; or any kind of conſumption, there muſt be a proportionable deduction and abatement from its excellency.</hi> For we reaſonably judge, that any thing which hath any intrinſecal good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, it is the more excellent, by how much it is more during, and of longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. Now take all thoſe excellencies which I mentioned as contradiſtinct to this <hi>fear of the Lord:</hi> They all of them have an uncertainty in them, which muſt neceſſarily with conſiderate perſons, abate of their true value. Though beauty be but a pittiful thing,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43194:65"/> yet how much more valuable were it than it is, if we did not ſee it a flower which upon every <hi>froſt,</hi> or <hi>cold wind;</hi> every ſickneſs and diſeaſe will fade? how much more valuable were ſtrength than it is, if age and ſickneſs would not make it abate? and riches, if they would not <hi>take to themſelves wings and flee away;</hi> and honour, if it were an indelible character. But alas! all theſe things are gourds; they come up, and they periſh too in a night. Beauty laſteth but a few years, if in the mean time no diſeaſe abate, or take it away. Strength hath no longer date. Riches are ſubject to the hand of violence, who may plunder them, and to the thief, who may <hi>break through and ſteal</hi> the goods which we had thought laid up for many years. They are alſo ſubject to the diſpoſal of divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, who often declares them <hi>moveables,</hi> and diſpoſeth of the ſtock of this world this or that way, as it pleaſeth him. Honours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the wills of Princes, and are given and taken away, when, and as they pleaſe. There is nothing of a certainty, or of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity in any of theſe things. But now the fear of the Lord is ſubject to no ſuch accident. <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall never depart from me.</hi> It is a thing (as I have ſhewed you) of <hi>infinite value,</hi> and is not ſubject to any change at all. It is a Jewel with which, when the ſoul is once adorned, it never putteth it off any more; but weareth it till it entreth Eternity, and puts on the Crown of Glory for evermore. It
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43194:66"/> is <hi>the ſeed of God,</hi> of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, which abideth in men, and keepeth the ſoul that it cannot ſin the <hi>ſin unto death.</hi> It is the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of living water, which when once it ſprings up in the ſoul, <hi>it ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up unto eternal life.</hi> It is a Jewel that will not be debaſed; gold, that will not admit of ruſt. O the excellency of grace above all the periſhing excellencies of other things! which (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of thoſe beggerly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) <hi>periſh with the uſing.</hi> We may ſay of this <hi>fear of the Lord,</hi> compared with other excellencies, as the Prophet ſpeaketh of the <hi>graſs</hi> and the <hi>flower,</hi> compared with the word of the Lord; <hi>The graſs withereth, and the flower fadeth; but the word of the Lord endureth for ever.</hi> Beauty withereth, and ſtrength withereth; <hi>Riches</hi> fade, and <hi>Honours</hi> fade; and all other created excellencies <hi>wither</hi> and <hi>fade;</hi> but the <hi>fear of the Lord abideth for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, <hi>All thoſe other excellencies fail the perſons which have them in the moſt needful times.</hi> If there were ſomething of vanity in beauty, ſome <hi>deceitfulneſs</hi> in <hi>favour,</hi> ſome <hi>emptineſs</hi> in all thoſe other things which I mentioned; yet much might be ſpoken for them, would they but ſerve a ſoul in an <hi>evil day.</hi> But if this be found true of them, that (like Swallows) they all leave us in <hi>Winter,</hi> and are furtheſt off from giving us that ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which we deſire from them, and they in appearance promiſe us in a time when we have moſt need of them; certainly this muſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43194:66"/> needs depreciate them in the view of every ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional eye. Now that they do this is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable paſt all denial. We have two <hi>evil daies;</hi> (I mean evil to our ſenſe) the day of <hi>Affliction,</hi> and the <hi>day of death.</hi> In the day of affliction, be it <hi>bodily</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> external or internal, what do all things in the world ſignifie? or wherein doth one man differ from another, ſave only by the <hi>fear of the Lord.</hi> The beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous face hath loſt its lovely colour. The ſtrong mans finews are looſed. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man is ignorant how to give himſelf eaſe. The prudent man is not wiſe enough to remove the diſtemper; nor yet under it to comfort himſelf. None of them, by their <hi>knowledge, learning, wiſdom,</hi> can ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from death; nor redeem their ſouls from the pit. <hi>As dieth the fool, ſo alſo dieth the prudent man; leave this life,</hi> and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit hath the poor creature of all thoſe fine things which before differenced him from his neighbour? wherein doth he now differ? he is alike laid in the grave with him. But in theſe hours the <hi>fear of the Lord</hi> is excellent, and of infinite advantage to the ſoul that is bleſſed with it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In a day of Affliction.</hi> It is true, <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>the fear of the Lord</hi> doth not deliver a man from the common incidents of that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal condition into which ſin hath brought us; it doth neither free us from <hi>troubles</hi> without, nor yet from <hi>fears</hi> within; but it giveth the ſoul <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> in this hour. <hi>Lord remember</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hezekiah) how I have walked</hi>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:43194:67"/> 
                     <hi>before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart.</hi> A man fearing God in an hour of affliction, is quite another man from one under the ſame kind and degree of affliction that he is; fuller of ſtrength, fuller of comfort; more ſatisfied with his condition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In the day of Death.</hi> It is true, the firſt curſe muſt have its verification. We have ſinned, and we muſt die. But <hi>dieth the child of God as a fool dieth? dieth a man fearing the Lord,</hi> as the man who hath <hi>no fear of God</hi> in his heart? ſurely there is a great difference in their latter end. Even <hi>Balaam</hi> had ſome ſight of this, when he deſired that <hi>he might die the death of the righteous; that his latter end might be like his.</hi> See that famous inſtance of <hi>David,</hi> a man indeed according to Gods own heart; yet you know how he failed both in the matter of <hi>Bathſheba</hi> and <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to the Application of the Point.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, what you have heard <label type="milestone">

The world (if this Doctrine be true) is greatly miſtaken, both in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning the moſt <hi>excellent things,</hi> and concerning the moſt <hi>excellent perſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay firſt, <hi>in their judgements as to the things that differ;</hi> and are more excellent than other. If you ſhould run to and fro the ſtreets of your City, and ask every one whom you
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43194:68"/> meet, <hi>Friend,</hi> let me have your opinion; what do you judge the moſt excellent thing in the world? it is very like they would not all agree in their anſwers; ſome would ſay, <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> and <hi>a ſatisfaction of their luſts.</hi> Others would ſay <hi>Riches;</hi> if a man had as much money as he could ſpend, a plentiful eſtate to live on. Others would ſay, <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Favour:</hi> if a man be great at Court, a favourite to Princes, they will judge him the happieſt man alive. It may be others would judge <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> is moſt excellent; or <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> is the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: but where ſhall we find a perſon who would ſay, <hi>The fear of the Lord</hi> is the moſt excellent thing? Some rare perſon poſſibly might be found, who would ſay with <hi>David; There be many that ſay, who will ſhew us any</hi>

Nay, even of thoſe who would ſay, <hi>Grace</hi> is the moſt excellent thing; how few are they whoſe practice would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them in what they ſpeak with their mouths? Man naturally <hi>loves, deſires, valueth, chuſeth, approveth</hi> the things which he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moſt excellent. The low opinion which the moſt men have of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>fear of the Lord;</hi> their little endeavours for it, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43194:68"/> purſuit after it, are plain inſtances (let men ſay what they will) that they judge other things more excellent. Yet, could you meet with any who had the ſentence of death in himſelf, any ſtrong apprehenſions that he muſt in a ſhort time go down to the pit, and upon whom the terrours of Hell had ſeized, this man would tell you, that of all things, <hi>the fear of the Lord is moſt excellent;</hi> which is enough to evince the truth of the thing, and that nothing but the violence of temptations, and prevalence of corruptions makes men to judge otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  </p>
                  <p>But leaving the ignorant world, which <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label> knoweth not the excellency of Grace; and is no fitter to judge between things earthly and ſpiritual, than the blind man is to judge of colours that differ. <hi>Will not this Doctrine convince Gods people of many errours in practice?</hi> There are a people in the Lord, who own the Lord, and ſeriouſly profeſs unto his fear; yet neither live as if they judged the fear of God the moſt excellent thing; or thoſe who <hi>fear the Lord</hi> the moſt <hi>excellent perſons.</hi> Give me leave to ſpeak freely to you, who I know do own what you have heard to be truth, and will profeſs a cordial aſſent unto it. Do you indeed judge the <hi>fear of the Lord,</hi> Grace, the <hi>beſt</hi> and moſt excellent thing? Do you judge perſons <hi>fearing the Lord,</hi> the <hi>moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perſons?</hi> I had rather you ſhould judge your ſelves, than my ſelf to pronounce ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt you. Let me therefore only offer you two or three Queſtions to propound to your ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether do you not value your ſelves more</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:43194:70"/> 
                     <hi>for other things, than for the fear of the Lord, with which you are bleſſed?</hi> It is true, through a <hi>demiſſiori,</hi> and humbleneſs of mind. Some naturally have lower opinions of themſelves than others have; but there is none lives but hath ſome value for him, or her ſelf. Men will ſpeak vilely and meanly of themſelves; and a child of God, from a principle of Grace, is <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>mean</hi> in his own eyes; but yet there is none who hath not ſome good thoughts for himſelf. Now I would have you inquire of your own ſouls, what that is which raiſeth your thoughts of your ſelves; <hi>Whether it be the fear of the Lord or no?</hi> The Prophet calleth out to us, <hi>Jer. 9. 24. Let</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 9. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>not the ſtrong man glory in his ſtrength; nor the wiſe man in his wiſdom; nor the rich man in his riches: but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he underſtandeth and knoweth the Lord.</hi> I am afraid, that if we ask our own hearts, wherein they chiefly glory? we ſhall find them ſincerely making us ſome other anſwer than this, that <hi>we glory chiefly in this, that we underſtand and know the Lord.</hi> Take a man or woman fearing God, if they have but the advantage of a little parentage, a little birth or breeding, or ſome great relations; are they not apt to glory in theſe more than in this, That <hi>God is their Father,</hi> the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt their Saviour? &amp;c.</hi> If they have but a <hi>little honour,</hi> or <hi>eſtate,</hi> are not their hearts more apt to glory in this, than in the riches of grace they have in poſſeſſion? or the riches of glory which they have in reverſion?
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43194:70"/> than in this great honour which the Lord hath dignified them with, that they ſhould be called the Sons of God? It is reported of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> a Chriſtian Emperour, that he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried more in this, that <hi>he was the ſervant of Chriſt,</hi> than that he was the <hi>Emperour of a great part of the world.</hi> I am ſure we ſhould glory more in our intereſt in Chriſt, than in all the world beſides. But alas how few are to be found that are truly of that good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours mind; that make their boaſt of God, and what he hath done for their ſouls; and look upon this as their great glory? yet if they do not, they do not in practice attend to what they profeſs to believe concerning the excellency of the fear of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether do you value others according to the fear of the Lord which you ſee in them?</hi> The Pſalmiſt gives this as the character of one who ſhall come to Heaven, <hi>Pſal. 15. 4. He in whoſe eyes a vile perſon is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord.</hi> Who is a vile perſon? there is a vile perſon in mans account; thus thoſe are vile who are <hi>poor and ſervile;</hi> whoſe condition in the world is mean and abject, are accounted <hi>vile.</hi> There is alſo a vile perſon <hi>in Gods account;</hi> ſo the only <hi>vile perſon</hi> is the <hi>lewd, debaucht, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinners;</hi> ſuch as God hath in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given up to <hi>vile affections, Rom.</hi> 1. 26. One that <hi>ſpeaketh villany, Iſa.</hi> 32. 6. Thus 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 13. The Sons of <hi>Samuel</hi> that <hi>lay with the women,</hi> who came to the Tabernacle and were prophane in abuſing holy things,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43194:71"/> are called <hi>vile perſons.</hi> So the prophane <hi>ſwearer, curſer, blaſphemer;</hi> the <hi>bruitiſh drunkard,</hi> the beaſtly <hi>unclean perſon;</hi> theſe are all <hi>vile perſons;</hi> God counts them ſo, the Scripture calls them ſo (let their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the world be what they will) God overlooks them, as ſignifying nothing in his eyes; they are all <hi>baſe, vile perſons</hi> in his eyes.</p>
                  <p>Now this is made the character of one that ſhall dwell in Gods holy hill; he muſt be one <hi>in whoſe eyes a vile perſon is contemned.</hi> Not that he ſhakes off his <hi>natural duty,</hi> or his <hi>moral ſubjection</hi> and <hi>duty</hi> to ſuch a one, if God hath put him or her in a ſubjection to them. A godly child honours his Parent (as his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.) A godly woman will honour and obey her husband (as her head.) A godly perſon will give <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to ſuch as are in Authority over him, though poſſibly they may be <hi>vile perſons,</hi> but not <hi>as ſuch;</hi> they will in their hearts contemn their vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and diſpoſitions, their lewd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane courſes, whiles they give that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and honour to them, which the Laws of <hi>Nature, God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> require, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Authority with which they are clothed toward us, and the ſubordination in which we are ſet towards them. But it is further added, <hi>He honoureth them</hi> [the Hebr. is, <hi>he glorifieth them] that fear the Lord. Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi> obſerveth, that it is an eaſie thing to <hi>contemn a vile perſon,</hi> eſpecially if his malice hath hurt us; but it is not ſo eaſie to honour
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43194:71"/> them that <hi>fear the Lord;</hi> eſpecially if they be ſuch whoſe lives before <hi>have been ſtained with ſin,</hi> and they are but in the <hi>exerciſe of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Or in caſe they live under wicked Magiſtrates, and are black through perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Or in caſe they be mean, and of ſmall eſtate in the world. But Sirs, if we be ſuch as fear the Lord our ſelves,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We cannot but have a true honour and value for thoſe in whom we ſee the fear of the Lord, let their circumſtances in the world be what they will;</hi> be they never ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, perſecuted, abuſed, be they never ſo mean and poor, in never ſo vile and abject a condition. But alas, how few are there who fall not under the reproof of the Apoſtle; <hi>Having the faith of God without reſpect of perſons.</hi> If one cometh near them with a gold Ring, and goodly Apparel (yea though <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 1.</note> he or ſhe be a vile perſon, which yet ſeemeth not to be the Apoſtles caſe) and <hi>there come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a poor man having vile rayment;</hi> have we not reſpect to them <hi>that have the gold Ring, and the goodly Apparel? and do we not deſpiſe the poor Chriſtian that hath the vile rayment?</hi> Do we not ſay to the former, <hi>Sit thou here in a good place?</hi> and to the poor, <hi>Sit thou there,</hi> or <hi>under my footſtool?</hi> Thus, do we not <hi>deſpiſe the poor,</hi> and in them oft-times thoſe that fear the Lord in an eminent meaſure and degree, and (at leaſt) interpretatively (as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith) <hi>Blaſpheme that holy Name by which we are called?</hi> It is our duty to value others accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fear of the Lord in them; and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43194:72"/> more or leſs excellent according to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the <hi>fear of the Lord</hi> which we diſcern in any of their ſouls; and we ſhould do ſo if we truly judged the <hi>fear of the Lord.</hi> As it is the moſt excellent thing, and the perſons that fear the Lord, the moſt excellent perſons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Ask your ſelves, <hi>what more excellent thing you do than others?</hi> Wherein you live a more noble, excellent life than others live? In reaſon, thoſe who judge themſelves the more noble and excellent perſons, ſtand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to live more diſtinguiſhing excellent lives ratable to their honour and dignity. The <hi>Gentleman</hi> thinks himſelf obliged to live as a <hi>Gentleman;</hi> the <hi>Noble man</hi> as a Noble man. And it ſpeaks a low and dirty ſpirit, for any man to look upon his honour and dignity, as that which gives him priviledge for a low and for did converſe. Chriſtians, do you live according to your order and dignity? You that are Chriſtians indeed, are <hi>the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of the earth: David</hi> calls you ſo; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon evinceth you to be ſuch. You have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended above all others in divine favour; you excel others in <hi>ſpiritual gifts;</hi> in what do you live ratably to your order? It was our Saviours queſtion to his Diſciples, <hi>What do</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 47.</note> 
                     <hi>you do more than others? Matth.</hi> 5. 47. In what doth your converſation towards God more diſtinguiſh you? Are you more in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, in prayers, in reading the Word, in hearing of it, in communion with Gods people, more holy, more patient? &amp;c. Wherein doth your converſation more ſhine
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43194:72"/> before men? Are you more humble, more meek, more juſt and exact in your dealings? more free and liberal, more compaſſionate and merciful? This is to live ratably to your order and profeſſion; and if you do not do this, you do not live like the moſt excellent perſons. But I proceed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>What you have heard may give you</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3 Branch.</note> 
                     <hi>the true notion of one fearing the Lord.</hi> The fear of God is an excellent thing, and in ſome degree approves its ſelf to the natural reaſon of men; but more yet to thoſe who in an outward Profeſſion (at leaſt in ſome degree) own the Scripture as the Rule of their life and converſation. Hence it is that every one is a pretender to it, and thinks it an high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to him, to be thought or diſcourſed of as a perſon <hi>not fearing the Lord.</hi> Hence you ſhall obſerve in our Law, in the ordinary indictments for <hi>Felonies,</hi> this is put in, Such a one <hi>not having the fear of God before his eyes,</hi> did this or that, &amp;c. But amongſt thoſe who would be thought perſons <hi>fearing the Lord,</hi> we ſhall find that the number of ſuch as indeed do fear him, is a very ſmall number. You may judge from what you have heard, who they are who indeed do fear God. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Not every one that ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Not every one who ſaith, he <hi>feareth the Lord,</hi> doth indeed fear him. How many are there that ſay ſo, to whom we muſt reply, as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> boaſting of his obedience, <hi>What</hi>

                     <hi>then meaneth the bleating of the Sheep, and the lowing of the Oxen?</hi> What mean thoſe bold and preſumptious actions againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord? What means that courſe of ſin which they run; that trade which they make of diſhonouring God? Yea and as it is not every one that faith, <hi>he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lord;</hi> nor is it every one that hath ſome dread of God upon him, at ſome times, of whom it can be ſaid, that he is a perſon fearing <hi>Jehovah.</hi> There is ſo much <hi>Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> ſo much <hi>Greatneſs</hi> and <hi>Ability</hi> to puniſh every created Being in the <hi>Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> that every creature naturally dreadeth God; even the <hi>Devil</hi> that hateth God, yet <hi>trembleth:</hi> (So the Apoſtle tells you) <hi>The Devils believe and tremble.</hi> And there was never any perſon in the world ſo <hi>vile,</hi> but at one time or other, ſomething of this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it ſelf in him.

                     </gap> this be ſo, where is that perſon to be found of whom this can be predicated; or how ſhall any perſon ſatisfie himſelf, that he is by the <hi>fear of the Lord</hi> diſtinguiſhed from another? This is a great queſtion; and the Holy Ghoſt having thought fit to expreſs the whole of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs</hi> by this notion, the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of it will exceedingly tend to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of ſuch ſouls as <hi>thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> To which purpoſe now I ſhall lay down ſome few Concluſions, which will open this thing to you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A true fear of God in what ſoul ſoever it is found, is not only the product of ſenſe; but the operation of faith.</hi> This is one great and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial difference betwixt that fear and dread of God which may be found in a natural man, and that which is ſound in every true child of God. There is a terrour, and awe, and dread of God, which (as I told you before) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeizeth the hearts of the greateſt Atheiſts, and moſt debaucht wretches in the Earth. But this dread is ordinarily but the effect and product of ſenſe: the poor wretch ſeeth ſome terrible work of God, and trembleth; or feeleth ſomething of the weight of Gods hand. Hence, as ſoon as the impreſſion is off his ſenſe, the fear and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43194:74"/> dread of God is alſo off his heart. And thus it will be with all that <hi>fear,</hi> which is but the product of ſenſe. The natural mans fear is not at all cauſed from <hi>faith;</hi> neither from the <hi>habit of faith</hi> which is within us; nor from the <hi>object of ſaith</hi> which is without us (I mean the Word of God) he doth not fear God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of what the holy Scriptures tell him concerning God, he believeth not that. But now the fear of God in a gracious ſoul is the iſſue of ſaith. A Chriſtian knows the Scripture, and what that revealeth concerning God: and now the Lord having by his Spirit wrought up his ſoul to give a firm and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt aſſent to what is revealed in his Word: he feareth the great God as much when he ſeeth or feeleth nothing of the greatneſs of his power in his works of Providence, as when he is under the greateſt demonſtrations of ſenſe. It is the precept of <hi>Solomon, Prov. 23. 17. Be thou in the fear of the Lord at all times.</hi> Indeed, he that is not in the <hi>fear of the Lord</hi> at all times, doth truly fear the Lord at no time: for where fear is the operation and fruit of ſaith, the effect is as abiding and permanent as the cauſe: now the cauſe of the fear of the Lord in that perſon, is his firm aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to what is revealed in the holy Scriptures concerning God. The Word of the Lord abiding the ſame for ever; and the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in it having an eternal verity; and the ſeed of God alſo once caſt in the ſoul, ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s in it, it is impoſſible but this ſoul ſhould have a <hi>fear and dread</hi> of God upon
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43194:74"/> his heart in <hi>health,</hi> as well as in <hi>ſickneſs;</hi> in <hi>proſperity,</hi> as well as in <hi>adverſity;</hi> in a time of the <hi>greateſt liberty,</hi> as well as in a time of the <hi>greateſt ſtraits,</hi> when the Providence of God may propoſe the greateſt objects of terrour unto him. If the ſoul of any at all times dreadeth and reverenceth the great God of Heaven and Earth; and that by reaſon of what the Word of God revealeth, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth concerning him; this is an excellent ſign, that the true fear of God is in that ſoul. Though it is true, the various workings of Divine Providence, may make this fear (as to the ſervile part of it) higher and greater at ſome one time than at another.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Although the true <hi>fear of the Lord in any ſoul, be not conſiſtent with a courſe of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate ſinning againſt God, and defying the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty; yet it is confiſtent in the ſame ſoul with many ſinnings, both of ignorance and of infirmity.</hi> If there were none feared God, but ſuch as were wholly free from ſin, there were no ſuch excellent perſon in the world as I have been diſcourſing of: For <hi>who liveth and ſinneth not againſt God?</hi> But I muſt open this General.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay, <hi>the fear of God is not</hi> (in any ſoul) <hi>conſiſtent with open defiances of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, or conſtant courſes of deliberate ſinning.</hi> There are ſome in the world that live in an open defiance of Heaven; the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical blaſphemer, the prophane ſwearer and curſer; and ſuch like eminent ſinners: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that cometh near them, may ſay, the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43194:75"/> 
                     <hi>fear of God</hi> is not in theſe perſons: No nor with any courſe of <hi>deliberate</hi> or preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous finning, when a man is free and under no height of temptation, to do this or that thing which he knoweth to be what God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden him to do, and yet he will do it, and doth do it; and that not once only, but again and again, from one day to another, making a courſe of it, how dwelleth the fear of God in that ſoul? God hath ſaid, he that doth theſe things ſhall die; he ſhall be plagued in this life, and he ſhall die eternally. The poor wretch knoweth this, and yet preſumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth theſe things; how can the dread or fear of God be in any judgement of charity judged to dwell in this ſoul?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But I ſay, the <hi>fear of God is conſiſtent in the ſoul with much ſin;</hi> either <hi>ſins of ignorance,</hi> or <hi>ſins of infirmity.</hi> Experience teacheth this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For <hi>ſins of ignorance:</hi> a ſervant may truly fear his maſter, and a child his father; and yet they may both do many things that their ſuperiours would not have done, if they do not perſectly know their will: It is ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the child and ſervant of God, and his Father and Maſter which is in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſay it is alſo conſiſtent with much <hi>ſinning of weakneſs and infirmity: Sins of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi> are of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as are of <hi>pure weakneſs</hi> and <hi>infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> which are failures in ſuch things; as through our <hi>natural weakneſs</hi> and <hi>impotency we cannot perform.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as are mixt with ſomething of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43194:75"/> 
                     <hi>wilfulneſs;</hi> but yet the great cauſe of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of them, is ſome <hi>original weakneſs and infirmity in us.</hi> Such now are thoſe ſins which we commit, upon the prevalence of ſome <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> or <hi>paſſion</hi> in us, whether <hi>love,</hi> or <hi>fear,</hi> or <hi>anger, &amp;c.</hi> Luſt prevailed on <hi>David;</hi> fear on <hi>Peter:</hi> and truly it is hard to ſay what ſin that is, which upon this account, a ſoul <hi>truly fearing God,</hi> may not fall into. He that conſidereth, that <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with <hi>Wine;</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> committed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, <hi>Abraham</hi> fornication, or <hi>adultery</hi> rather: what <hi>David</hi> did in the murther of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> and taking of <hi>Bathſheba</hi> to his bed: what <hi>Peter</hi> did in the hour of temptation; and what <hi>Job</hi> did in his paſſion, will (I ſay) be at a great loſs to fix upon ſuch a ſin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which he can ſay, this is a ſin which one fearing God cannot be guilty of. On the other ſide; there is no ſin which a child of God can live in, making it his conſtant courſe and practice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though <hi>the fear of God will conſtrain a ſoul to every duty; yet even the ſoul which truly feareth God, may either through ignorance, or through weakneſs, fail much in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his duty.</hi> I ſay, the fear of God will <hi>conſtrain a ſoul to the performance of every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> By duty, I mean, whatſoever God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth to be done; your reaſon teacheth you this. Will any of you think, that your child or ſervant feareth you, who will not do every thing which you command them? The Centurions ſervants feared him; he ſaid to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43194:76"/> one, <hi>go,</hi> and he went; to another, <hi>come,</hi> and he came, to a third, <hi>do this, and he did it.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul that feareth God, doth likewiſe. But yet I ſay, even that ſoul which truly feareth God, may yet fail much in the performance of ſomething of his duty: And that,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Through <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>forgetfulneſs.</hi> The child that truly feareth his Father, may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly not know; or if he hath known, he may have forgotten ſomething that his Father would have him do: So may a child of God; <hi>We know in part</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) and what we do know, we (through forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our duty) do not alwaies attend to in the hour when we ſhould do it:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, Through <hi>wantonneſs;</hi> we have (the beſt of us) wanton hearts, which are eaſily led aſide from our duty; and while we are in the world, we are incompaſſed with a multitude of temptations, we are ſubject to be flattered from our duty, by the <hi>Sirens</hi> of the world, and to be frowned from our duty, by the frowns of the world. And indeed, if the flatteries and frowns of the world have no influence upon us; yet our ſpiritual duty is a thing that agreeth not with fleſh and blood; it pincheth our fleſh, and that is very ready to ſay to us, <hi>Spare thy ſelf;</hi> or to ſuggeſt to us, that God doth not expect from our hands; or at leaſt will not ſtrictly inſiſt upon ſuch meaſures of duty as the holy Scriptures ſeem to lay out for us; but God will give us leave for five hundred, to ſet down fifty. <hi>Who liveth.</hi>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:43194:76"/> and doth not fail much in his duty?</p>
                  <p>But yet as to this point of duty, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will be ſeen more in a ſoul truly fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, than in another ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, The ſoul fearing the Lord, <hi>will not live in a conſtant neglect or omiſſion of any known duty.</hi> It is one thing to omit a duty at this or that time; another thing never to perform it. A man or woman fearing the Lord, may under the force of ſome temptation; or in a multiplicity of buſineſs, erre; by omitting a morning or evening ſacrifice of prayer or praiſe, or in the ſtrict obſervation of the Lords day. But it is not poſſible that ſuch a one ſhould live in a conſtant violation of the Lords Sabbath; or without God in the world from day to day, and from week to week, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much as calling upon his Name; the reaſon is, becauſe the fear of the Lord in his heart, biaſſeth him to his duty; and though ſome worldly diſtraction (like a rub to a Boul) turneth him out of his road; yet when he is over that, the <hi>biaſs</hi> works again, and his ſoul turneth to his courſe. Again,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, A ſoul truly <hi>fearing the Lord, will hardly omit ſuch duties as God in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hath put ſome ſpecial Emphaſis upon.</hi> For as it is in our commands to our children; though we may command them many things; yet there may be ſome things that we lay a greater fireſs upon, that our children or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants underſtand our <hi>ſpecial will</hi> to be, that we ſhould be careful in them: So it is in the precepts of God; there are ſome which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:43194:77"/> Lord hath in his Word laid a great <hi>Emphaſis</hi> upon them: Our Saviour juſtifieth this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, when he telleth the Phariſees, They <hi>tithed Mint, and Annis, and Cummin; but neglected the greater and weightier things of Gods Law.</hi> Now here the ſoul truly fearing God, will be very ſtrict, and will very rarely omit theſe. And hence poſſibly it is that ſouls truly <hi>fearing God,</hi> are generally found very ſtrict <hi>in the matter of his worſhip;</hi> both as to the thing, and as to the manner of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, God having in his Word more <hi>Emphatically</hi> and ſeverely declared his will in theſe things: So in matters of <hi>Righteouſneſs and Mercy;</hi> and in all ſuch other things as are the weightier things of Gods Law.</p>
                  <p>Thus far I have ſhewed you, how the fear of the Lord in any ſoul where it is, works, both 1. In reference to the <hi>Word of God;</hi> it trembles at that. 2. In reference to <hi>ſin.</hi> 3. In reference to <hi>duty.</hi> I ſhall proceed yet a little further in this Argument, giving you ſome notes of a perſon <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>? fearing the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, <hi>A perſon fearing Jehovah, will have upon his heart a great awe of Divine Judgement;</hi> or <hi>whatſoever looketh like ſuch.</hi> There is no perſon truly fearing the Lord, but in ſome meaſure underſtandeth what that Lord is; and being poſſeſſed with a true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, it is as natural for the rational creature to fear him, in the leaſt roarings of his judgements; as for the <hi>beaſts of the Forreſt to tremble when the Lion roareth.</hi> For as their
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43194:77"/> trembling proceedeth from a natural ſenſe of their ſubjection to the Lion, and the Power he hath over them: So doth this perſons dread proceed from the apprehenſions he hath of the Greatneſs and Majeſty of the Divine Being; as alſo from what he believeth of his ſeverity and juſtice. Beſides this; There is no ſoul truly fearing God, but hath been at ſome time or other, leſs or more under the <hi>ſpirit of bondage;</hi> or ſome way or other felt the weight of Gods hand; and as we ſay, <hi>Ictus Piſcator ſapit;</hi> and it is natural for a child that hath been once ſmartly whipped, to fear the hand of the Father or the Maſter a ſecond time: So it is for the child of God, having once felt the weight of Gods hand, he trembleth at every lifting of it up, whether it be againſt himſelf or others. Now it is true; the natural fear of a meerly carnal man, as well as the reverential fear of the child of God, will diſcover it ſelf upon this occaſion, and it may offer a foundation of a new queſtion; <hi>How that reverential fear of God in his judicial diſpenſations, which is, and ought to be found in a child of God, may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from that ſlaviſh and aſtoniſhing ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which may fall upon the vileſt perſons in the world.</hi> Let me have your patience to add a word or two to this, before I ſhut up this branch of Application.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, take a carnal man, who hath in him no more than a natural dread of God, he is <hi>ſeldom</hi> or <hi>never affected at the lifting up of the hand of God;</hi> only
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43194:78"/> when it <hi>falls down heavy upon himſelf.</hi> Look as men in correcting their children, they <hi>lift up their hands,</hi> firſt (in order to their ſtroke) ſo the great God is ſet out to us in Scripture. Take the vileſt of men; they tremble when the hand of the Lord is upon them in ſome remarkable judgement, that they feel the ſmart of Gods Rod; but they ſeldom take notice of Gods hand <hi>lifted up, Iſa. 26. 11. Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee; but they ſhall ſee, &amp;c.</hi> There are three waies by which Gods hand may be ſaid to be lifted up.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In the comminations of his Word applied by his Meſſengers.</hi> God in his Word hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his wrath plentifully againſt ſinners. Now it is Gods uſual method (eſpecially as to Nations, and ſuch Nations where the Name of God hath been publiſhed) as of old to raiſe up his Prophets to give people warning; ſo more lately to raiſe up ſome <hi>Miniſters</hi> amongſt ſuch a people, faithfully and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to apply the threatnings of Gods Word to ſuch a people. Now here Gods hand is lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up: This now the child of God that truly feareth him, will ſee and take notice of, and ſuit himſelf accordingly. You ſee it in the inſtances of almoſt all the good Kings of <hi>Judah.</hi> But others will not ſee this lifting up of Gods hand. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſtretcheth out his hand againſt the <hi>Prophet. Ahab</hi> conmands <hi>Elijah</hi> to priſon; and ſo doth <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſerve the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, the hand of God may be ſaid to be
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43194:78"/> 
                     <hi>lifted up, when God ſendeth either ſome leſſer judgements, as fore-runners of greater; or elſe by ſome ſigns in nature doth indicare iram,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his wrath. Now this lifting up again of the Lords hand, the natural man will not ſee. There is that which God chargeth the Jews with, by his Prophet <hi>Amos, ch.</hi> 4. 6, 8, 9, 10, 11. God ſometimes ſhews his <hi>ſigns in the Heavens,</hi> and alters the courſe of nature, as an indication of his wrath. Of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was the <hi>Ecclipſe</hi> at our Saviours death; the <hi>Enſis flammivomus,</hi> ſeen hanging over <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> many <hi>prodigious Comets,</hi> and other ſigns taken notice of by all Hiſtories, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods eminent pouring out of his wrath upon a place. Take now a child of God, when he ſees theſe things, he is afraid, though he dare not venture to give <hi>a particular judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them;</hi> yet they make him to tremble and reverence God, as believing he is doing ſome terrible work, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third way whereby Gods hand may be ſaid to be <hi>lifted up</hi> againſt a perſon or Nation, is, <hi>when God makes ſome other like ſinners examples of his vengeance.</hi> Our Saviour taught us this, when he made to his Diſciples that improvement of the <hi>Judgement of God</hi> fallen upon the <hi>Galileans,</hi> and upon thoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom the <hi>Tower of Siloam fell;</hi> telling the people, that <hi>except they repented, they ſhould all likewiſe periſh.</hi> Now a man or woman truly fearing God, takes notice of theſe lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings up of Gods hand, and fears; but uſually another never trembleth till the vengeance of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43194:79"/> God overtakes himſelf; he puts the evil day far from him, and will give no heed to ſuch leſſer judgements, as uſually forerun greater; nor yet will he take notice of any ſigns of Gods approaching wrath; nor mind the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of it upon others. But this is but the firſt thing, and not univerſally in all points true. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, If he doth at all take notice of any of theſe things, <hi>he feareth with a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, or with a meer ſervile fear.</hi> Fear much prevails according to the <hi>natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</hi> Perſons naturally <hi>melancholick,</hi> are prone exceedingly to fear; and where you find natural men thus complexioned, it is not extraordinary to find them affrighted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at the ſigns or beginnings of Divine Vengeance: but one of theſe two faults their fear hath: It is either 1. <hi>Superſtitious:</hi> Or 2. <hi>Meerly ſlaviſh. Superſtitious,</hi> without any ground at all from the words of God. Such are theſe fears raiſed by <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> and <hi>Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazers,</hi> and vain obſervers. Thus it is given as the character of a wicked man, <hi>That he feareth where no fear is, Pſal. 53. 5. i. e.</hi> where <note place="margin">Pſal. 53. 5.</note> there is no true ground of fear, no true and juſt ground. And <hi>Prov. 28. 1. He fleeth when none purſueth him.</hi> Or elſe, 2. <hi>His fear is a meer ſervile fear,</hi> and that in a very great exceſs. God threatens his people, that in caſe they were ſound diſobedient, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>ſend a faintneſs upon their hearts, and the ſound of a ſhaken leaf ſhould chaſe them.</hi> And ſuch ordinarily is that fear of Judgement
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43194:79"/> which falls upon the hearts of natural carnal men: Or if not a <hi>judicial puniſhment;</hi> yet a meer exceſs of natural paſſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Though a natural man may fear Divine Judgements; yet his fear never brings him cloſer to God.</hi> A carnal mans fear of Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hath many effects upon him, and thoſe very various, according to the different temper of perſons. Some are made by it <hi>deſperate,</hi> and to defie the God of Heaven; as <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate (they ſay) threw up his Dagger to Heaven, and cried, <hi>Viciſti Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> Thou haſt overcome me O thou <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilean.</hi> Others, their fear hath ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon, that (like thoſe rebellious <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, Jer.</hi> 42.) they will preſently reſolve to remove from that place which God makes the Theatre of his Judgements. Thus in times of <hi>Plague,</hi> or other <hi>contagious Diſeaſes,</hi> or <hi>War,</hi> they will remove from their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Yea, though upon a rational view of things, a prudent man would ſee no great cauſe for it. <hi>Fear</hi> upon others hath ſuch an effect as <hi>Nabals</hi> fear had upon him, to kill him: his heart upon it (ſaith the text) grew <hi>dead as a ſtone.</hi> Others, it may be their fear hath an influence upon, to bring them to ſome <hi>hypocritical humiliation.</hi> So <hi>Ahabs</hi> fear made him <hi>walk ſoftly,</hi> and <hi>put on ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth.</hi> But the fear of Judgements never hath ſuch an operation upon a meer carnal man, as to make him take up any ſerious thoughts of ſearching what the quarrel is which God hath againſt him, and throughly humbling
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43194:80"/> himſelf before God for his ſins, which have been the cauſe of his wrath, and to turn from them by any ſerious reſolutions, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours after reformation. This was the influence that <hi>Joſiahs</hi> fears had upon him. Indeed you ſhall ſee the difference betwixt the beſt of natural men in their fears of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the child of God, in thoſe two inſtances of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Joſiah. Ahab</hi> was a moſt wretched Prince; God ſends a Prophet to him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 19, 20, 21. to tell him (in ſhort) that God would ruine him and his family, and all that belonged to him, <hi>v. 27. Ahab</hi> hears thoſe words, <hi>he rends his cloths, puts ſackcloth upon his fleſh, faſteth, lyeth in ſackcloth, and goes ſoftly.</hi> Here's the beſt of a carnal man; if his dread of God in his Judgements, worketh thus far, and to a temporary abſtaining from ſome groſs ſins, it is all; you read not a word of <hi>Ahabs</hi> tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to inquire of the Lord; not a word of any <hi>cordial humiliation,</hi> or <hi>reſolved reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2 King. 22. 11. Joſiah</hi> findeth the Book of the Law, and heareth there of the wrath of God, <hi>he rends his cloths</hi> (ſo did <hi>Ahab)</hi> but he reſteth not here, <hi>v. 13. He tends to inquire of the Lord for him, and for the people, and for all Judah, &amp;c.</hi> was this all? No, <hi>chap. 23. He ſets upon a real and effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation with all his might.</hi> Thus you ſee how the dread and awe of God upon the heart of a child of God, doth not drive him from God, but unto him; it doth not ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie, but quicken him; it doth not put him
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43194:80"/> upon a <hi>formal, temporary, particular reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but upon a fixed, real, <hi>general reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Pharaohs</hi> fear flartled him, and put him upon ſending to <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray for him; and put him upon ſome good thoughts and reſolutions at preſent; but yet <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, was one who feared not the Lord. But thus much may ſerve to have ſpoken to this branch of Application.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the laſt branch: I will ſhut up this diſcourſe with a few words of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. I will reduce all to three particulars.</p>

                  </p>

                     </gap>, to perſwade them to it. It is a frequent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in holy Writ, <hi>Levit. 19. 14. Fear thy</hi>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:43194:81"/> 
                     <hi>God, I am the Lord, ch. 25. v. 17. 43. Eccleſ. 5. 7. Matth. 10. 28. 1 Pet. 2. 17. Rev. 14. 7. Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 13. God calls to you, <hi>Fear God. Solomon</hi> calls to you, <hi>Fear God.</hi> Our Saviour calls to you, <hi>Fear him that can caſt both body and ſoul into Hell fire.</hi> The Angels in Heaven call to you, <hi>Fear God.</hi> All the Prophets and Apoſtles call to you <hi>unâvoce,</hi> and this is that which they ſay, <hi>Fear God.</hi> The meaning of this you have heard. Not only dread the great and living God in the ſecrets of your hearts; but let all your converſation ſavour of this fear: ſo comport your ſelves in your whole carriage both towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your neighbours, as you may evidence to the world, not only that you have a natural ſenſe of that infinite diſtance which is between your Creatour and you; and the power that he hath over you; but that you may ſhew that you have this gracious habit of fear wrought in you, and that you fear God in the Scripture phraſe. You ſee this is a great picce of the will of God concerning you, preſſed upon you again and again in holy. Writ. Give me leave to inlarge a little in preſſing it upon you. I ſhall firſt give you ſome Arguments. Secondly, I ſhall offer you ſome directions in the caſe, from the text: And what I have ſaid, furniſheth me with two great Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>This is Wiſdom. This is Grace, Job 28. 28. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e fear of the Lord, that is wiſdom, Prov. 1. 7. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> That man who hath nothing of the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43194:81"/> fear of God in him, hath nothing of God, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Grace of God in him. On the other ſide, that perſon who hath in him <hi>the fear of God,</hi> hath all; that is an holy, that is a gracious man. There can be no more ſaid of any, than that he or ſhe are perſons <hi>not fearing God.</hi> Nor can there be <hi>better</hi> ſaid of any, that he or ſhe is a perſon fearing God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, (You have heard) a perſon fearing God, is <hi>the moſt excellent perſon in the world; Favour is deceitful; Beauty is vain; but a woman fearing the Lord, ſhe ſhall be praiſed.</hi> Others may call themſelves <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;</hi> and the men of the world may call the <hi>proud happy;</hi> but the truly happy, the truly excellent perſon is one fearing God. I might add a third.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This is the only perſon who deſerveth to be praiſed, and whoſe works will truly praiſe him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let others be commended and admired for beauty, for riches and honour; and another for learning; as the end of all is, <hi>to fear God, and keep his Commandments;</hi> So that perſon that truly anſwereth this end, and doth fear God, and keep his Commandments, will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beſt evidence, (which is that of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and reaſon) appear to be the perſon that is moſt worthy of <hi>praiſe and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now if I could ſay no more than this, to engage any to this ſtudy; yet in other things this would be enough. Every one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deſireth the things that are excellent, and is naturally covetous of honour and praiſe. Would you have that which is in it
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43194:82"/> ſelf moſt excellent? that which will make you above all others <hi>excellent?</hi> that which moſt truly deſerveth <hi>praiſe,</hi> and will make you the trueſt objects of praiſe? Oh get this <hi>fear of the Lord!</hi> Give me leave to add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Argument or two.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the fourth place, <hi>Conſider the many Promiſes made in Scripture to the fear of the Lord, Prov. 10. 27. The fear of the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth daies, Prov. 14. 26, 27. In the fear of the Lord is ſtrong confidence, and his children ſhall have a place of refuge. The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to depart from the ſnares of death, Prov. 15. 16. Little with the fear of the Lord is great gain, v. 33. The fear of the Lord is the inſtruction of wiſdom, Prov. 19. 23. The fear of the Lord tendeth to life, ch. 22. 4. By the fear of the Lord are riches, Pſal. 112. &amp; Pſal.</hi> 128. are full of Promiſes to <hi>the man that feareth God.</hi> The things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in theſe, and thoſe many other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes annexed to <hi>the fear of the Lord,</hi> are ſuch as every one defireth. Who would not have <hi>long life, riches</hi> and <hi>honour?</hi> Either you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scriptures, or you do not believe them; if you believe the Scriptures to be the Word of God, you muſt aſſent to whatſoever Propoſitions are revealed in them, as Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitions of eternal and infallible truth; whether the Propoſition be <hi>dogmatical, or promiſory, &amp;c.</hi> And indeed if you ſo believe, you cannot but judge your ſelves reaſonably engaged, to labour for this fear of the Lord which ſhall moſt certainly have ſuch a train of bleſſings waiting upon it.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:43194:82"/>5. I will add one thing more; <hi>There is no ſuch preſervative from all evil both of ſin and puniſhment.</hi> Evil of puniſhment is ſenſible evil. Evil of ſin is the greater evil, but not ſo obvious to ſenſe, while the poor creature liveth here. As to the former (the evil of ſin) there's no ſuch preſervative againſt that, <hi>Prov. 16. 6. By the fear of the Lord men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from evil.</hi> It is of the nature of fear well rooted in the heart, to lay a reſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, from provoking the perſon of whoſe power we are afraid. And 'tis impoſſible that a ſoul ſhould truly fear God, and yet boldly, knowingly, and deliberately provoke him to vengeance. There is no ſuch preſervative from the evil of ſin, as the fear of the Lord is. Nor is there any ſuch preſervative from <hi>evils of puniſhment.</hi> This indeed followeth upon the other; for all puniſhment is the fruit of ſin, <hi>Prov. 28. 14. Happy is the man that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alway: but be that hardneth his heart ſhall fall into miſchief.</hi> It is not, <hi>he that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alway,</hi> but <hi>he that bardneth his heart that falleth into miſchief.</hi> I ſhall add but one thing more.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly, <hi>There is no ſuch remedy againſt the ſlaviſh fear of the creature,</hi> as this filial and reverential fear of God. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.

A greater fear doth as naturally ſwallow up a leſſer, as a greater pain (of the Stone, or the like) drowneth the leſſer, and cauſeth it hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be diſcerned. Now this is no ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, <hi>The bondage of fear,</hi> which in this life we are ſubject to, is no ſmall bondage; and it is no ſmall bleſſing to be delivered from it. But let this be enough to have ſpoken by way of motive, to perſwade people to this <hi>fear of Jehovah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have ſpoken ſo much concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent habit, that me thinks I cannot but in charity judge there is by this time kindled in your hearts ſome deſires after it, and hear you whiſpering; How ſhould I get this fear of the Lord? In order to it, let me commend to you ſomething of <hi>Meditation, Obſervation, Caution, Faith, Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt thing is <hi>Meditation;</hi> as to which in this caſe, let me commend to you a double Object; <hi>The Word of God: The Works of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Word of God, Deut. 4. 10. I will make them to hear my words, that they may learn to</hi>

                     <hi>fear me all the daies they ſhall live.</hi> The holy Scriptures (as to the matter of them) have much in them, which hath a natural tendency to affect the hearts of men and women with this dread of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They tell you <hi>what God is;</hi> what a great and glorious <hi>Majeſly;</hi> what a <hi>pure and holy God</hi> he is; what a <hi>juſt and ſevere God</hi> he is: How infinite his Power is, that he <hi>killeth and</hi>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:43194:83"/> 
                     <hi>ſaveth alive whomſoever he pleaſeth;</hi> throws to Hell, and brings to Heaven whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, from whence every rational ſoul muſt neceſſarily conclude the ſubjection of his poor feeble nature unto him; and this appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, as to any thing, is the foundation of fear in us: I mean, of all reverential and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile fear. They likewiſe tell you what God is in his Goodneſs and Mercy; and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of this is the foundation of all filial fear.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They tell you <hi>what God hath revealed that he will be, and ſhew himſelf to be,</hi> both to all impenitent and preſumptuous ſinners, and to all thoſe who are his children. And</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They tell you much <hi>what God hath been towards all ſorts in the ancient iſſues of his Providence.</hi> Now I would have you not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to read theſe, but to <hi>meditate on them.</hi> Meditation is the ſouls <hi>ſtand</hi> upon its object; its weighing of matter propoſed, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it. The want of this is one great cauſe there is ſo little dread of God in the world. Have not men the Scriptures? What houſe is there amongſt us, in which are not many Bibles? Do they not read them? ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do, but they do it in a vain formality, without a due digeſtion and meditation, ſo as the notions of holy Writ leave no impreſſion upon their hearts. Would men but allow the Word to have a place in their hearts: did the Word of God dwell in them, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible (one would think) but this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of it ſhould be left behind; men
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:43194:84"/> could not talk and walk as they do.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let the <hi>Works of God</hi> be alſo the matter of your <hi>meditation. Come and ſee</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>what deſolations he hath wrought in the earth.</hi> The truth is, the wheel of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath turned ſo ſtrangely in the world, ſince the world had an exiſtence, that if men could give themſelves leiſure to think of its motions, to conſider them in their cauſes, in the manner of their revolution, in the things brought to paſs by them; one would think it impoſſible but that it ſhould affect their hearts with a dread of the Divine Majeſty: But of this more by and by.</p>

Theſe, and ſuch like examples are daily before our eyes, and we obſerve them not; and therefore we <hi>fear not God.</hi> Chriſtians, if you would fear God,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43194:84"/> obſerve the workings of his Providence much how in his great works he is daily confirming his Promiſes to his people, and his threatnings to his enemies. If the Word of God will not make you fear him; yet ſurely his works muſt: his works by which you ſee him juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, and giving a Being to his Word.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you would get this <hi>fear of God, take heed of thoſe things which have a direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to harden your hearts from his fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take heed firſt of <hi>Atheiſtical Principles.</hi> There is a bundle of Principles (ſome of which have grown too faſt too in theſe evil times) which are calculated for the very Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of Atheiſm; and deviſed as if it had been on purpoſe to baniſh all dread of God out of mens hearts. <hi>That things are not ordered by Providence,</hi> but come in a <hi>meer ſeries and ſucceſſion of neceſſary, natural cauſes. That there are no ſpirits: no ſuch things as indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of divine wrath. That there is no Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be made from Providences.</hi> If we ſhould ſee the Earth open and ſwallow up <hi>Corah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> and <hi>Abiram;</hi> yet there is nothing to be concluded, but theſe may be as honeſt men as thoſe that do not <hi>go down quick into the pit.</hi> Theſe, and ſuch like Principles, are Doctrines deviſed on purpoſe, to make men <hi>faces of Braſs,</hi> that they might not <hi>bluſh;</hi> and <hi>necks of Iron,</hi> that they might not bow at any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine rebukes; but might <hi>out-face God</hi> to the utmoſt, until he tear them in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Take heed of cuſtomary ſinning</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Nothing ſo contributes to <hi>fear</hi> as <hi>faith.</hi> Both <hi>faith of aſſent,</hi> and <hi>faith of adherence.</hi> Faith of aſſent is that habit by which we give aſſent to the Propoſition of the word. <hi>Faith of Reliance</hi> is a <hi>gracious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi> by which <hi>we reſt upon the perſon of the Mediatour.</hi> Either of theſe hath an influence upon us to beget this fear and dread of God in our ſouls.

The <hi>excellent of the Earth. Solomon</hi> tells you here, that <hi>Favour is deceitful;</hi> and <hi>Beauty is vain:</hi> but a <hi>woman fearing the Lord, ſhe ſhall be praiſed. Though many Daughters have done vertuouſly, yet ſhe hath aſcended above them all.</hi> Oh let us thus iudge.

                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to the Explication of the latter part of the text, which I told you in thoſe words: <hi>[I ſhall be ſatisfied]</hi> The <hi>Septuagint</hi> reads it, I ſhall be feaſted. 1. The word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a <hi>plentifull filling.</hi> The word by which the Greek Interpreters tranſlate it, ſignifieth ſuch a <hi>filling,</hi> as the beaſts are filled with: eating graſs, you know, they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very full, ſeeding meerly by ſenſe, and according to appetite, under no regulation of reaſon: Thus it is uſed, <hi>Hoſea 13. 6. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their paſture, ſo were they filled: and their heart was exalted.</hi> To this degree are ſouls ſometimes filled (in this life) with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of grace: Thus are the ſouls of the Saints filled with Gods manifeſtations of himſelf to them in glory: Such ſometimes are the ſhinings of divine light upon the ſoul, on this ſide of Heaven, that it knows not how to bear any more: it is filled with a <hi>joy</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:43194:100"/> 
                     <hi>unſpeakable,</hi> and <hi>full of glory.</hi> But in the other life, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> Yet even then the glory of the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> will be above the glory of the <hi>brighteſt Star:</hi> They ſhall be glorified with the <hi>ſame glory,</hi> as Chriſt and his Father are glorified, as to the kind; not <hi>as to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it:</hi> we can receive but according to our <hi>capacity.</hi> In ſhort, they ſhall be ſo filled, as they ſhall deſire no more: The word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <hi>perfect fulneſs;</hi> and therefore Criticks derive it from a word that ſignifies <hi>ſeven,</hi> which in the dialect of Scripture, is the number of <hi>perfection: Seven times a day will I</hi>

                  <p>But further yet, the word ſignifies a <hi>filing as with dainties,</hi> as a man is <hi>filled at a feaſt,</hi> a man may be <hi>filled with bread,</hi> but at a feaſt we are uſually filled with <hi>pleaſant bread</hi> (as <hi>Daniel</hi> calleth it) So then, when <hi>David</hi> ſaith, he ſhall be ſatisfied, he in effect ſaith, I ſhall be <hi>filled</hi> ſeven times; <hi>filled brim full, perfectly filled,</hi> as at a feaſt: And indeed thus ſhall the ſouls of Gods people be <hi>filled;</hi> but <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>how,</hi> are two queſtions which by the remaining words muſt be reſolved.</p>

                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:43194:100"/> or <hi>to watch.</hi> For the form of the words, it admits this variety of interpretation. The LXX. read it, <hi>When thou ſhalt appear unto me.</hi> The <hi>Vulg. Lat. When thy glory ſhall appear unto me.</hi> We will firſt conſider the original word in its <hi>latitude</hi> of ſignificancy, and then <hi>weigh</hi> what it here importeth.</p>
                  <p>The word in the Hebrew comes from a roo, which ſignifies three things. 1. <hi>To make tedious. 2. To watch. 3. To awake.</hi> The two latter alone can fit this text; and betwixt thoſe two interpretations, I find all valuable interpreters divided. The Hebrew properly is <hi>in watching,</hi> or <hi>in awaking.</hi> We tranſlate it, when <hi>I ſhall awake</hi> (there's no material difference.) I will begin with the firſt, which is ſomething different from our Engliſh; <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfied in watching;</hi> or while I watch for thy likeneſs. Thus this very word is tranſlated, <hi>Ezek. 7. 6. An end is come, it watcheth for thee.</hi> I confeſs I am loth to exclude this ſenſe of the words: <hi>I' ſhall be ſatisfied in watching for thy likeneſs. Watching</hi> is but an empty, hungry action, and gives the ſoul no ſatisfaction; but here's the difference betwixt <hi>watching for the world,</hi> and <hi>watching for God.</hi> As to worldly things, <hi>Hope deferred makes the heart ſick:</hi> as to God it is not ſo. <hi>A watching and waiting for God,</hi> brings a proportionable ſatisfaction: It ought in a great meaſure to ſatisfie a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul, in his hours of darkneſs, if he doth but find God inabling him to watch for <hi>his likeneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:43194:101"/>
                  <p>2. But the word is otherwiſe tranſlated and properly enough [in waking, or <hi>when I ſhall awake]</hi> or be <hi>made to awake.]</hi> Thus the word is often tranſlated in Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. 6. and in many other texts. <note place="margin">Pſal. 3. 6.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some apply this to God, as if it ſhould be <hi>when thou awakeſt.</hi> Indeed the Hebrew is no more than in <hi>awaking,</hi> or in <hi>being made to awake. When thy faithfulneſs ſhall awake</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Others (as I noted before) making the words to be the words of Chriſt, underſtand them of his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> Our Saviour knew that when he by death had ſatisfied <hi>Divine Juſtice,</hi> by the accurſed death, and born the brunt of his Fathers wrath, he ſhould awake the third day, by a glorious Reſurrection; and having conquered death, and ſatisfied juſtice,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43194:101"/> he ſhould again behold his Fathers face clear from all clouds and frowns, aſcending up on high, and ſitting on the <hi>right hand of God.</hi> This is <hi>Hierom</hi>'s notion of the text: but doubtleſs the text is not to be ſo reſtrained.</p>

                  <p>1. By his <hi>awaking,</hi> I find ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, his <hi>recovery and deliverance from that afflicted ſtate in which at preſent he was.</hi> Indeed the time of affliction, is a time of night, and often in Scripture is expreſſed under the notion of <hi>darkneſs,</hi> which gives advantage to this interpretation, which both <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Mollerus</hi> favour, thinking it by others applied to the Reſurrection, <hi>argutè magis quàm propriè,</hi> more ſubtilly than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly.

                  <p>But (with all due reſpect to thoſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters whom this ſenſe pleaſeth,) I rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to thoſe, who interpret this <hi>awaking</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> To make it clear.</p>

The words thus opened, afford us two things, as grounds of <hi>Davids</hi> ſatisfaction, in that dark condition in which he was. Though his ſtate was but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſad, and uncomfortable: though lately he neither had ſeen God, nor heard from him, only had ſeen and felt the ſrowns and thunderings of his providence againſt him, yet he would be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If he found God inabling him, in this his ſad, perplexed, perſecuted ſtate, to wait upon him, and exerciſe grace in watching for him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the aſſurance he had, that though as yet he were unſatisfied, and might poſſibly fall aſleep ſo in death; yet in the reſurrection of the juſt he ſhould awake from that ſleep; then he ſhould have enough of God, and be fully ſatisfied <hi>with his likeneſs.</hi> I have only that one term more to open.</p>

So <hi>Numb. 12. 8. The ſimilitude of the Lord ſhall he behold:</hi> That is,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43194:103"/> I will make an impreſſion of my divine <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> upon him, by which he ſhall be able in ſome meaſure, to conceive of, and to comprehend me.

God told <hi>Moſes,</hi> he could not ſee his <hi>face</hi> and live; but his <hi>ſimilitude he ſhould behold:</hi> he would make upon his ſpirit an impreſſion of his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs.</hi> But let us now inquire more ſtrictly what this <hi>likeneſs of God</hi> in the text is: The <hi>Septuagint</hi> interpret it; <hi>The glory of God.</hi> I ſhall be ſatisfied <hi>with thy glory;</hi> that is a truth, but whether the whole of the truth, I doubt. Some think <hi>the Ark of God is meant,</hi> which the wife of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> called the <hi>glory of Iſrael.</hi> And that <hi>David</hi> in this his afflicted ſtate, comforted himſelf with this conſideration, that he one day ſhould again ſee the <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> the <hi>power</hi> and the <hi>glory of God</hi> in his <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> We read alſo, that when he fled from <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> brought the Ark after him, he bid him carry it back again, if the <hi>Lord had a pleaſure in him, he would bring him back, and he ſhould ſee it, and his holy habitation.</hi> But I think we ſhall find that <hi>glorious Symbol</hi> of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, no where ſtiled <hi>Gods likeneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others think, that by <hi>Gods likeneſs</hi> here, <hi>David</hi> underſtands <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is indeed
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43194:104"/> called the <hi>brightneſs of his Fathers glory; the expreſs Image of his perſon.</hi> And that <hi>David</hi> here comforts himſelf (as <hi>Job</hi> before him) that he <hi>ſhould ſee his Redeemer with thoſe eyes.</hi> Thoſe who interpret the text as the words of Chriſt; by <hi>Gods likeneſs</hi> here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the <hi>glory</hi> of God, wherewith Chriſt was <hi>glorified</hi> after his <hi>reſurrection from the dead,</hi> and <hi>aſcenſion.</hi> But I take all theſe ſenſes to be too much forced upon the text.</p>
                  <p>There are three things which I think may be all comprehended under this term.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a likeneſs of God in us. Adam</hi> was at firſt created in Gods image or likeneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. And in our <hi>Regeneration</hi> the <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note> image of God is ſaid to be renewed in us, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. And we are ſaid to be created af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Col. 3. 10.</note> the <hi>image of God, in righteouſneſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> Thus we are commanded to <hi>be holy as the Lord is holy.</hi> This is now the image of God within us; the impreſſion of the ſpirit of Grace upon our hearts, by which we are made partakers of the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> I take this to be much the ſenſe of the place; Lord, if thou ſhalt inable me in my dark hours to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to perfect holineſs, I ſhall be ſatisfied; though I want comfort, yet I ſhall be much ſatisfied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f I be but inabled to watch for a further degree in holineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, We may take <hi>likeneſs, for Gods manifeſtations of himſelf to us, by his ſpirit of conſolation.</hi> In this life we do not ſee God as he is; but he ſometimes makes gracious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of his love unto his people in the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:43194:104"/> ſenſible conſolations of his Spirit, reflecting divine Love upon the ſouls of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and ſealing them up to the day of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) though I do not ſee the Lord in this <hi>likeneſs</hi> of his; though I want the aſſurances of his love, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable manifeſtations of his gracious Spirit; yet Lord, it ſhall ſtay me, if I find thy grace inabling me, but to wait for theſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, Gods <hi>likeneſs</hi> may be taken for <hi>the glorious manifeſtation of himſelf</hi> to his Saints in another life; and this I take to come fulleſt up to <hi>Davids</hi> meaning. O Lord, though while I live here, I walk in the dark, and ſee no light; while I am beholding thy face in righteouſneſs, and watching for thee; though I may go down to the grave, and ſleep my ſleep in the duſt, not fully ſatisfied, not ſeeing what of God I would do: yet this I know, that in the reſurrection I ſhall awake, and then I ſhall be made amends for all which my ſoul hath ſuffered in its dark and ſad hours, under the ecclipſes of divine light: I ſhall then be filled with God; I ſhall ſee him <hi>as he is, face to face;</hi> and my <hi>vile body</hi> ſhall be made like to my <hi>Redeemers glorious body.</hi> Thus I have largely opened the words; take the ſubſtance of them ſhortly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> was at this time in a ſad condition, both</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of the perſecution againſt him from without:</hi> And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The divine deſertion which at this time clouded his inward man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:43194:105"/>3. And <hi>the temptations which attended him in theſe ſtraits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this verſe he takes up his reſolution what he would do; and alſo ſhews us what ſtayed his heart, and gave him ſomething of ſatisfaction in his perplexity.</p>
                  <p>That which he reſolveth to do, is to <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> in which to behold the face of God, to live an holy life and converſation, and to manage his cauſe againſt his enemies in a juſt and innocent manner.</p>
                  <p>That which he fixeth upon as his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Gods preſent inabling him to perfect holineſs in his fear, and to wait for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of divine light.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His ſure hopes, that if he ſhould fall aſleep in death, not ſatisfied; yet there would be a reſurrection from the dead, and in that glorious morning, he ſhould awake, and then he ſhould be filled with the manifeſtations of God: this is the ſubſtance of the words. Now ſuppoſe your ſelves to hear <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking the ſame thing more copiouſly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O Lord,</hi> my ſoul is in a ſad and perplexed condition; <hi>without are fightings, within are fears;</hi> mine enemies are many, and proud, and cruel as Lions; they are men of power and eſtate, whoſe bellies are filled with hid treaſure. I am poor, and empty, hunted like a Partridge upon the Mountains: Firſt <hi>Saul</hi> roſe up againſt me; now mine own Son is in rebellion, and my ſoul alſo, O Lord!

But this ſhall be my work; this ſhall be that which I will ſtudy, and look after: I have fixed mine eyes upon thy love and favour; let the men of the world look after that; let them look upon their great eſtates, I will behold thy face, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the light of thy countenance, and that I may obtain it; I truſt not in my own righteouſneſs; in the righteouſneſs of my Lord <hi>I will behold thy face.</hi> I will endeavour in thy ſtrength to live an holy and righteous converſation; <hi>perfecting holineſs in thy fear;</hi> and in all things endeavouring to live up to thy mind and will diſcovered to me: and for this cauſe, which I am (through thy providence) managing againſt thoſe who have riſen up againſt me, I will manage it righteouſly, with all integrity and innocency toward them who are ſo fierce and cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l againſt me: And in this reſolution, <hi>O Lord,</hi> in my affliction, it will be a great ſtay unto me, if I may but find the conunuance of thy ſtrength inabling me to labour after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the renovation of thine image in my ſoul; and to wait for the further ſhinings
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43194:106"/> out of the light of thy countenance: if I can but find thee thus appearing to my ſoul, I ſhall at preſent endeavour to be ſatisfied, knowing that it will not be long before I ſhall fall aſleep in death, and from that ſleep I ſhall awake in the morning of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and then I ſhall be abundantly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with thy likeneſs, ſeeing thee face to face, and rejoycing in thy preſence for ever more.</p>
                  <p>The words thus opened, will afford us many Propoſitions; ſome I ſhall but lightly touch upon, haſtening to what I intend for the ſubject of a fuller diſcourſe.</p>

                  <p>And as it is poſſible that they may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied as to the manifeſtations of Gods love unto them; ſo they may be, and often are

Nay more, afflictions, as they are tokens of <hi>divine wrath,</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:43194:110"/> and legal <hi>demands of ſatisfaction</hi> to Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, cannot fall upon Gods people, but he hath reſerved to himſelf the liberty of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in love and kindneſs to chaſtiſe his <hi>people with rods.</hi> The people of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould not think it ſtrange, if they meet with theſe dark iſſues of divine providence; nor ſhould any entring into the waies of God promiſe himſelf a freedom from afflictions, and trials of this nature. Chriſt hath ſecured us eternal ſalvation, and all neceſſary means and influences of grace in order to it; but he hath not totally exempted us from the rod of <hi>affliction:</hi> But this is not all. The ſecond Propoſition ſpeaketh yet more.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>As to Gods Image in them;</hi> this lies in the perfection of holineſs, and is ſo far true, that it is hard to find a child of God, whoever as to this died ſatisfied, what Chriſtian on his death-bed ever ſaid, he had <hi>faith enough,</hi> or <hi>love enough,</hi> or <hi>holineſs enough? David</hi> cryes out, <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God.</hi> And where is the ſoul, that departing to eternity, ſees not reaſon to complain that <hi>his heart hath not been ſo with God as it ought to have been.</hi> The beſt of men ſinneth ſeven times in a day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But it is true alſo as to the apprehenſions of <hi>divine love,</hi> not being able when they die to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43194:110"/> ſay aſſuredly, <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> What ſhall we ſay to the great example of our Lord and Saviour? It is true, he knew he was the eternal Son of God, that after his reſurrection he ſhould be <hi>glorified,</hi> with that <hi>glory</hi> which he had with his Father from all eternity; and in this reſpect might differ from ſome of his children, who dying, may want that certainty, and only die with a <hi>good hope through grace:</hi> yet in this dying hour he cryes out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Nor can we well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how he ſhould for us die <hi>under the curſe, and ſenſible feelings of divine wrath,</hi> unleſs we grant, that he died under the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings of the ſenſible manifeſtations of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love: and certainly <hi>the Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the Servant above his Lord.</hi> Our own experience alſo proves it: have not we known ſome perſons, of whom while they went in and out with us, could ſay, <hi>Theſe are the anointed of the Lord;</hi> we ſaw them walking cloſely with God, fearing every ſin, making conſcience of every duty, ſerving the Lord (ſo far as we could judge) <hi>in ſpirit and truth;</hi> and this not in a fit, but conſtantly; yet when they came to die, their Candles went out in obſcurity: We have not ſeen them in that <hi>triumph of faith,</hi> that <hi>fulneſs of joy and peace,</hi> which it may be we did expect: Not able to ſay with <hi>Job, In</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 19. 26. Rom. 8 38.</note> 
                     <hi>my fleſh I ſhall ſee God;</hi> nor (with <hi>Paul) I am perſwaded that neither life, nor death, ſhall ſeparate me from the love of God in Chriſt.</hi> Nor
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:43194:111"/> is there any thing in ſpiritual reaſon to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. <hi>Senſible manifeſtations</hi> are <hi>none of our neceſſaries.</hi> God hath no where promiſed, that they ſhall not fail the ſoul in death. Mr. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford</hi> (I remember) propounds this to be obſerved; <hi>Whether uſually, when in the time of their life, the Saints of God have felt many reflexions of divine love, many ſenſible conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: God hath not left them to die in the dark: And on the contrary, when any of his children, have in the time of their life, been full of fear and dejections, &amp;c. God hath not uſually in their ſick and dying hours, ſhined upon them with viſions of peace.</hi> It is not to be fixed as a ſtanding Rule, (for the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is neither to be limited, nor tracked in his goings) but it may be worthy of our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>Now this ſeemeth a very hard diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Gods people oft-times know not how to live without <hi>ſenſible manifeſtations</hi> of his love; but they are much more at loſs, how to ſatisfie themſelves to die without it. May we therefore in any degree of humility gueſs at ſome reaſons of ſo ſad a divine diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, it is enough (to a modeſt ſoul inquiſitive in this particular) to ſay, <hi>Even ſo, O Father, becauſe it pleaſeth thee.</hi> God will have us to know, that the wind bloweth both <hi>where it liſteth, and when it liſteth;</hi> and that his Spirit is not leſs free. We ſhall not know the hour when he will viſit his peoples ſouls; nor will he conſtantly come
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:43194:111"/> in at the ſame hour, that he might aſſert his own liberty to us; this may be one, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is the great reaſon to be aſſigned of this diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lord may have a deſign by it to make a trial of his ſervants faith.</hi> It is a good faith that will long maintain a living Saint with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſight: but it muſt be a ſtrong faith which will maintain a Chriſtian in his dying hour without it. This was the faith of <hi>Job, Though he kills me, yet I will truſt in him.</hi> This is a faith which holds out to the end, and ſhall have the Crown of life, which God hath promiſed. It is the laſt act of faith to ſerve a departing ſoul. Love goes with the ſoul into another world; Faith parts with it at the gates of death; the viſion of faith is then changed for the beatifical viſion: <hi>What a man ſeeth, how doth he hope for?</hi> That faith that ſeeth Chriſt through a glaſs darkly, hath its eyes in death quite out: The ſoul comes with open face to behold the glory of God. It argues a great ſpirit in a ſouldier, to fight to his laſt breath: And it ſpeaks a couragious ſtrong faith, for a Chriſtian to die believing: dying hope is a good hope; therefore it is given as the character of a righteous man, that <hi>he hath hope in death.</hi> And of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite it is ſaid, <hi>Where is the hope of an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, when God takes away his ſoul? Job</hi> ſaith, that <hi>his hope ſhall be like the giving up of the Ghoſt.</hi> Look, as dying men fetch their breath <hi>ſhorter</hi> and <hi>ſhorter,</hi> till at laſt it quite fails them: ſo are the preſumptuous hopes
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43194:112"/> of hypocrites; the nearer they come to death; the ſhorter they fetch the breath of their hopes, till at laſt they quite fail them, and they die either ſtupid, or deſpairing. God makes a great trial of his Saints faith, when he calls them to die in the ſtrength of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>God may have a deſign in it to honour his Word.</hi> If we wholly lived upon ſight, the Word of God would not be ſo precious to us; the Promiſes would not be ſo dear to us. (Though I conſeſs it is a very ſuſpicious comfort, which the Word brings not into our ſouls) but yet conſolatory diſpenſations are the more ſpecial and extraordinary ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of the Spirit, in a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary improvement of the Word. Gods Word appeareth, and is made very precious to the ſoul, when it hangs its whole weight upon it, being not at all advantaged from ſenſible reflexions. <hi>I had periſhed</hi> (ſaith <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 92.</note> 
                     <hi>David) in my affliction, if they Word had not been my delight.</hi> What an honour there did <hi>holy David</hi> put upon the Word of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, that the whole weight of his periſhing ſoul hung upon it, and it ſuſtained him. Indeed there is a ſecret powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Holy Ghoſt, tcaching and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling the ſoul to lay hold upon, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this Word. But in <hi>faith of adhere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e,</hi> though the Spirit be the great Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of it, teaching and inabling the ſoul to lay hold upon, and to apply the Promiſe; yet it is by a more ſecret and inſenſible act, and the Word appeareth moſt in maintaining
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:43194:112"/> that. Oh! faith the ſoul, had it not been for ſuch a Word, ſuch a Promiſe; ſuch a good word of God is a <hi>faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation.</hi> In the reflex act of Faith, which giveth the ſoul a plerophorous evidence, or a full perſwaſion of its evidence in God, the work of the Spirit appeareth more extraordinary and glorious; the vertue of the Word doth not ſo much ſhew it ſelf. Now the Lord will ſometimes honour his Word in the fight of his children, letting them ſee that it is enough to ſupport, bear up, and to uphold a ſoul, though it ſhould never ſee the face of God till it come in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet the Word is enough ſecurely to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it thither.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>God in ſuch a diſpenſation may have a deſign to teach his people, that ſalvation doth not depend upon ſenſible conſolatory manifeſtations.</hi> Not upon the ſweet application of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to the ſoul (an act wherein we have no ſhare, it being the Lords work alone, and marvelous in our eyes) but upon the ſtrong and ſteddy application of our ſouls to the Promiſe. This latter is <hi>juſtifying faith;</hi> the other is <hi>the faith of one already actually juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> We are too prone to lay too much upon ſenſible comforts. Some there are who will acknowledge no other notion of faith, but a <hi>full perſwaſion of the love of God,</hi> and ſo indeed confound <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>ſight,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſeemed ſo warily to diſtinguiſh, when he told us, <hi>We live by faith,</hi> and not by <hi>fight.</hi> And again, that <hi>hope which is ſeen, is</hi>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:43194:113"/> 
                     <hi>no hope;</hi> and indeed, cut the throat of many a poor Chriſtians comfort, who, it may be, all his life, cannot come to ſuch a ſenſible evidence. Indeed the moſt judicious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are prone to lay too much ſtreſs upon theſe conſolatory manifeſtations, and to think all nothing if they want them. Now this is a great error which the Lord may aim at the correction of in his people by ſuch diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, letting the ſoul ſee there is vertue enough in his Word to bear it up through the deepeſt waters of affliction, without the bladders of ſenſible manifeſtations. Enough in that, and the ſouls application of it ſelf to that, though until it come in Heaven, it never ſees the face of God. It is believing that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the ſoul to Heaven, <hi>i. e.</hi> an hungring and relying upon Chriſt, and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alone; not that <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> which is the conſequent of believing, and that too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent and uncertain. And indeed I do not know any one truth, that needs more rooting and confirmation in a gracious heart. The life of ſenſe is the life of the Saint trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant. The life of faith is the life of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant Chriſtian. Though God ſometimes condeſcends in ſuch manifeſtations to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and deſires of his people, and is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give them a glimpſe of glory, as the earneſt penny of a future greater reward, which he intendeth them: yet theſe muſt not be lookt upon as the neceſſaries of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; but what God gives <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

See here <hi>(my friends!) you of little of faith, here's a child of mine, coming alone to me without the ſtaff of ſenſe; truſting me upon the credit of my bare word: Here's one that hath not ſeen, and yet hath believed; that hath dared to take my word for Heaven.

                  <p>But although the great curſe ſo far falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beſt of men, who are made alive by the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> although the decree of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven touching them as well as others, and their houſe of clay be ſuch as muſt be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved</hi> as well as others, and they muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the common fate of fleſh and blood, and having been wearied with the labours of this life, it is but reaſonable they ſhould a while reſt in their beds in the grave; yet they ſhall not be like thoſe mentioned by the Prophet, who ſhall <hi>ſleep</hi> a <hi>perpetual ſleep.</hi> Though they <note place="margin">Jer. 51. 39.</note> ſleep, they ſhall <hi>awake;</hi> though <hi>they fall,</hi> they ſhall <hi>ariſe,</hi> therefore their enemy death hath no cauſe to triumph over them. <hi>Our friend Lazarus ſleeps;</hi> but I go (ſaith Chriſt) <note place="margin">Joh. 11. 11. 23, 24.</note> that <hi>I may awake him out of ſleep.</hi> Thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſhall riſe again,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Martha;</hi> ſhe aſſents to it; <hi>I know that he ſhall riſe again at the reſurrection in the laſt day.</hi> As death is called a ſleep; ſo the reſurrection from the dead, is called an <hi>awaking out of ſleep.</hi> Thus
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:43194:119"/> in <hi>Daniel, Many that ſleep in the duſt ſhall awake,</hi> Dan. 12. 2. <hi>Awake and ſing you that dwell in the duſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle.) That there ſhall be a <hi>reſurrection,</hi> is an article of our faith, and ſo momentous aone, that it is one of the pillars upon which Religion ſtands. <hi>If the dead riſe not, then is not Chriſt riſen</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and if Chriſt be not riſen, then is our preaching in vain, and your faith is alſo in vain; and the Apoſtles are found falſe</hi>

And if Chriſt be not riſen, your faith is yet in vain, you are dead in your ſins, and they alſo who are fallen aſleep in Chriſt are periſhed.</hi> By this, and a far greater plenty of arguments, the Apoſtle confirms a neceſſity of a <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> It is true, the Reſurrection belongs to wicked men, as well as to the <hi>children of God;</hi> they alſo <hi>ſhall riſe,</hi> they ſhall come to judgement; but the reſurrection ſhall be ſo much to the <hi>damage</hi> and <hi>detriment of ſinners,</hi> that we ſhall find (in Scripture) the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as if it were the ſpecial priviledge of Gods people, <hi>Phil. 3. 11.

                     <hi>ſatisfied with the Lords likeneſs.</hi> By the likeneſs of God here, I mean the <hi>beatifical viſion;</hi> the manifeſtation of God to his Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when they ſhall be ſatisfied with ſeeing him as he is, and beholding him <hi>face</hi> to <hi>face.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The child of God, while he lives here, is ordinarily not ſatisfied with grace; he knows in part, and he prophecieth in part; he is not holy enough; he cannot ſo perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as he deſireth; nor (ordinarily) hath he thoſe clear and conſtant incomes of divine love, and viſions of peace, as he wiſheth for: But in the Reſurrection he ſhall be filled; he ſhall be ſatisfied.</p>

                        </gap>ſly filled:</hi> Here we are fed with morſels, as we are able to digeſt, and accordingly as our wiſe Father ſeeth beſt for us, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were fed with <hi>Manna;</hi> when we ſhall come in the heavenly <hi>Canaan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> we ſhall be fed with <hi>milk</hi> and <hi>hony,</hi> and with a flow of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, He ſhall be <hi>perfectly filled.</hi> When our <hi>corruptible</hi> ſhall have put on <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> and our <hi>mortal</hi> ſhall have put on <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,</hi> we ſhall yet be but finite Beings, and ſhall not be capacious enough to receive the fulneſs of divine light and glory. The <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> though they agree the immediate paſſage of the ſoul to God, when it departeth from the body, yet will not allow it to be perfectly bleſſed before the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſay, there will remain in the ſoul in its ſtate of ſeparation, a deſire to a ſecond union; and while one deſire of the ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth unſatisfied, there cannot be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:43194:120"/> of bleſſedneſs; but in that day <hi>that which is in part ſhall be done away,</hi> that which is perfect being come.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>whole man ſhall then be ſatisfied</hi> with the likeneſs of God. Here the ſoul ſometimes beholdeth God by <hi>ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,</hi> by the <hi>viſion of faith,</hi> by <hi>ſpiritual reflection,</hi> (when God is pleaſed ſo far to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge his child) but here the eye of the body ſees nothing of him, in the reſurrection we ſhall ſee him <hi>with theſe eyes in our fleſh,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job.</hi> After the diſſolution of our bodies, the ſoul indeed ſhall with open face behold the glory of God, but our bodies ſhall be rotting and putrifying in the graves; but in the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, the whole man, both ſoul and body, ſhall ſee God, and be happy in the enjoyment of him to all eternity. In our fleſh we ſhall ſee him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, The <hi>degrees of ſatisfaction we ſhall have there, are infinitely above what the ſouls of Gods people enjoy here:</hi> Here we ſee, but it is as <hi>in a glaſs darkly;</hi> there we ſhall ſee <hi>face to face:</hi> here if at any time God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth his comfortable face to us, yet we can but ſee him according to our preſent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity; but in that day the capacity of the ſoul will be inlarged, and the ſoul to its utmoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged capacity, ſhall be filled with the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: Here we ſee him <hi>by the eye of faith,</hi> ſitting upon his <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> and that fight is full of glory; there we ſhall ſee him by the eye of ſenſe upon his Throne of Glory; that ſight will be infinitely more
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:43194:121"/> glorious and beatifical. Here the child of God ſometimes ſeeth God; and though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be wanting, <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> to make him perfectly happy in that viſion, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unchangeable fulneſs; yet much is wanting <hi>ex parte ſubjecti,</hi> our capacities not being able to receive in much of ſo glorious a light; there is a deficiency in our ſight, and ſuch a vaſtneſs of glory in the object, that we can but comprehend a little of it. In ſhort, the ſoul in that day ſhall be ſo filled with the likeneſs of God, that it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for it to receive any further additions. Yet to obviate the miſtakes of ſome, who know not what they ſay. As in this life, the meaſure of the <hi>fulneſs of the ſtature of Chriſt,</hi> is but our mark, not the attainment of any ſoul; none ſo pure, ſo holy, ſo righteous as Chriſt: ſo in that life which is to come, none ſhall be ſo <hi>glorious</hi> as Chriſt. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God ſhall, like <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ride in the <hi>ſecond Chariot;</hi> but Chriſt (who is the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image of his Fathers perſon)</hi> ſhall be greater in this <hi>Throne of Glory,</hi> than any of Gods people can be; he is of his <hi>Fathers Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;</hi> the <hi>brightneſs of his Glory;</hi> the <hi>Word;</hi> his Fathers <hi>expreſs Image,</hi> who ſo aſſerts an equality of the Saint, either in grace or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to the only begotten Son of God, cannot avoid a double blaſphemy. <hi>The exalting a finite Being to the dignity of an infinite Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence;</hi> or <hi>the degrading the Creatour, and equalizing him with a creature.</hi> But this is a digreſſion. Certain it is, that the children of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:43194:121"/> God in the reſurrection ſhall be filled with the likeneſs of God, though they ſhall not have ſo much of it as the only begotten Son of God. The proof of this is evident from thoſe many phraſes in Scripture: We ſhall ſee him <hi>as he is, face to face; we ſhall be like him;</hi> in which I have before inſtanced.</p>
                  <p>I have now ſhortly opened thoſe five Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pofitions, which I told you were implied in the Propoſition; I come now to what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Here are two grounds of ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, from <hi>Davids example,</hi> (according to the various ſenſe of the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) for a child of God living under ſuch a dark diſpenſation; yea if God ſhould call them to die under it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They ſhould be ſatisfied in watching for Gods likeneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ſhould ſatisfie them, <hi>that they ſhall in the reſurrection awake,</hi> and then they ſhall be ſatisfied with the likeneſs of God. Let me ſhortly diſcourſe the reaſonableneſs of both theſe. Firſt, I ſay, <hi>Though a Chriſtian ſhould in his life time walk without the ſenſe of divine love; yet he ought to be ſatisfied in caſe he findeth God inabling him to reſiſt ſin, and to hope in him, and by faith and patience to wait for him, and to order his converſation aright before him; or in ſhort, to watch for him, when he or ſhe doth not ſee him: Yea if God ſhould call him to die without thoſe ſenſible comforts which others have, and he poſſibly thirſteth after.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt firſt open to you how, and how
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:43194:122"/> far forth he ought to be ſatisfied, and then give you ſome reaſons for it.</p>
                  <p>Methinks I hear a child of God thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying upon me, <hi>Ah Sir, is this poſſible, that a Chriſtian ſhould be ſatisfied without the ſenſe of Gods love? a child that tenderly loves his Parent, ſatisfied under his frown? a wife un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der jealouſies of her husbands love? Are theſe things poſſible? Can a ſoul be ſatisfied ſo long as it is crying out, where is my God become? Can a ſoul awakened to a ſenſe of eternity be ſatisfied, to leave the earth, and go it knows not whither? This is an hard chapter, an hard ſaying, who can hear it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I anſwer, when I ſay a Chriſtian ſhould be <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> my meaning is, not that he ſhould be ſo contented with ſuch a <hi>diſpenſation,</hi> as not to <hi>deſire an alteration of it.</hi> This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed plainly impoſſible, that a Chriſtian awakened to conſider what the love of God to the ſoul is worth, ſhould live without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the manifeſtations of it to him; they may be thus ſatisfied, that never felt any thing of Gods wrath, nor were ever warmed with any beams of his ſpecial favour; but he that hath ever lived under any feeling of the wrath of God; or that hath ever been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the love of God, or felt any thing of the warm influences of it, can never be in this ſenſe ſatisfied; he muſt pant, and breath, and thirſt after Gods manifeſtations of himſelf to his ſoul, and uſe all poſſible means for the obtaining of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But as there is a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence</hi>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:43194:122"/> and <hi>delight,</hi> excluſive of any motions, any indeavours, any deſires for an alteration: ſo there is a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of <hi>content,</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to <hi>murmuring, repining, diſtruſt</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief;</hi> and in this ſenſe he ought to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not to <hi>murmure and repine againſt God,</hi> as not juſt, or wiſe, or good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not to <hi>diſtruſt God;</hi> not to give over waiting upon him, crying to him, doing his duty, not to deſpond and caſt away his hope in God as to his <hi>eternal ſalvation,</hi> for want of theſe ſenſible manifeſtations, he ought to be ſo far <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> as to be thankful for ſuch influences of grace as he hath, and <hi>with a meek and quiet ſpirit,</hi> to commit himſelf to the good will and pleaſure of God; to <hi>truſt in the Name of the Lord, and to ſtay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his God;</hi> to continue <hi>waiting upon God, and praying, and ordering his converſation</hi> ſo aright, that he may <hi>ſee the Lords ſolvation.</hi> Thus far ſatisfied a Chriſtian under theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ought to be.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, Becauſe <hi>he hath what may reaſonably give him ſatisfaction, notwithſtanding his want of ſuch more ſenſible and comfortable reflections.</hi> If you ask me what that is, I anſwer, that which the Apoſtle calleth <hi>A ſure word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;</hi> a word which ſhall not paſs away, though <hi>Heaven and Earth paſs away.</hi> Gods word of promiſe is ſecurity enough for our ſalvation, without the broad-ſeal of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: This is ſure <hi>to all the ſeed,</hi> Rom. 4. 16. <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 16.</note> Hence the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calleth <hi>Hope,</hi> an <hi>anchor of</hi>

To him that <hi>believeth,</hi> Joh. 3. 18, 36. <note place="margin">John 3. 18, 36.</note> 
                     <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting life.</hi> And again, <hi>He is not condemned: And to him that ordereth his converſation aright, I</hi>

                     <hi>will ſhew the ſalvation of God:</hi> And often, to him that <hi>waiteth for God.</hi> What are we, that the bare word of the Lord ſhould not ſatisfie us? It is a quaint notion I have ſomewhere met with, that God the Father had nothing but Chriſts word in ſecurity for all the ſouls, whom he took up into Heaven from <hi>Adam,</hi> until Chriſt had died. No price was paid for them; only Chriſt had given his word to his Father, that in the fulneſs of time he would come, and would die for them; upon this ſecurity he took them all into Heaven. Hath the word of Chriſt been taken for the ſalvation of ſo many thouſand ſouls (Chriſtian!) and doſt thou think it hard to take it for the ſalvation of thy ſingle ſoul? Ah! will a Chriſtian ſay, God forbid I ſhould not take his word; but I do not know that word was made to me? nor that I have any ſhare in it? I anſwer, thou knoweſt it is made to them that <hi>believe;</hi> to them <hi>that order their converſation aright;</hi> to them that <hi>love God;</hi> to them that <hi>wait on</hi>
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:43194:123"/> 
                     <hi>him;</hi> that <hi>thirſt after him.</hi> Canſt not thou ſay thou <hi>believeſt?</hi> or if that be not ſo clear to thee, canſt thou not ſay, thou <hi>loveſt God,</hi> that that thou <hi>thirſteſt after him,</hi> that thou art afraid <hi>to ſin againſt him?</hi> I muſt confeſs, if thou beeſt able to ſatisfie thy ſelf in none of theſe, thy caſe is hard: but if thou canſt ſee any thing of theſe, though thou doſt want ſuch a ſatisfaction from ſenſible reflections as thou deſireſt, yet thou haſt a <hi>ſure word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> which can never fall thee; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though thou mayeſt breath, and thirſt after the ſenſible conſolations of God; yet if God in his wiſdom thinks fit to deny thee them, thou oughteſt to be ſo far ſatisfied, as to be thankful, not to <hi>repine,</hi> not to <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,</hi> but meekly to commit thy ſelf to God, and quietly to wait upon him, even whiles he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He did him no wrong;</hi> therefore he had no cauſe to complain.</p>

                  <p>All theſe things (Chriſtian!) are appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable unto thee.

I ſay firſt, God in theſe diſpenſations doth thee no wrong; what haſt thou earned? Canſt thou challenge theſe ſenſible manifeſtations at Gods hand as due to thee in point of juſtice? if whatſoever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences thou receiveſt from God, muſt be acknowledged influences of grace, not debts, much more theſe; God therefore in denying them to thee, in with-holding them from thee, does thee no wrong at all; if he ſhould reſreſh thee with them, it were <hi>ſuperabound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

If thou couldeſt not challenge theſe comfortable manifeſtations as thy earnings; yet if thou couldeſt challenge them as debts from God upon compact, thou mighteſt indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of wrong done unto thee in the want of them; but there is no ſuch thing: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes indeed there are of ſuch kind of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; as there is of outward proſperity, health, riches, &amp;c. to be underſtood with a reſervation to Gods wiſdom, ſo far as he ſees good for thy ſalvation, and for his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>By hope</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we</hi>

                     <hi>hath hope in his death.</hi> It is not alwaies true, that the righteous man hath <hi>aſſurance</hi> in his death; but he hath hope in his death, an hope that maketh not aſhamed in his death, and ſo ſtandeth diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> of whom <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Where is the hope of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, when God takes away his ſoul?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. This hope (Thirdly) is enough to give the ſoul <hi>joy.</hi> Hence you read of the <hi>rejoycing of hope,</hi> which may be <hi>kept firm to the end;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 6.</note> it is not ſo with <hi>ordinary hope.

                     <hi>who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope before us; which hope we have as an anchor of the ſoul, ſure and ſtedfaſt; and which entreth into that within the vail, whither the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner is for us entred, even Jeſus, who is a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedeck.</hi> The two immutable things, are Gods <hi>Word,</hi> and his <hi>Oath:</hi> His <hi>word of promiſe</hi> that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable; <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, before a tittle ſhall paſs from it.</hi> His <hi>Oath,</hi> in that God hath condeſcended to our infirmity, that we might hope ſtedfaſtly. <hi>O nos foelices</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tertullian) quorum gratiâ Deus jurat.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:43194:127"/> Heaven, in the quality of a Prieſt, an eternal Prieſt, who ſtands alwaies before his Fathers Throne, preſenting his own mediatory per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances and merits unto his Father; the ſoul believeth in him, then raiſeth an <hi>hope of ſalvation,</hi> though it wants ſenſible evidences; and this hope is ſufficient to give unto the ſoul a ſtrong conſolation, having fled to Chriſt for <hi>refuge;</hi> however, to be an <hi>anchor to the ſoul,</hi> and that both <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>ſtedfaſt,</hi> which therefore ſhould ſtay it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Fifthly, <hi>Faith, and ſtrong Faith,</hi> is ſurely enough to carry a ſoul to Heaven; though it wants ſenſible evidences, if it be not, what becomes of the Covenant of Grace? what became of all the promiſes, repetitions, and branches of that Covenant? but a child of God may have faith, and ſtrong faith, and yet want <hi>ſenſible conſolation.</hi> I ſay, a Chriſtian may have <hi>faith;</hi> I do not mean only a faith of <hi>aſſent,</hi> which the <hi>Devils</hi> may have: (Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith) <hi>they believe and tremble</hi> (they doubtleſs do agree to the Propoſitions of truth in the Scripture) but I mean that <hi>faith</hi> which the Apoſtle calls, <hi>The faith of Gods Elect; Juſtifying faith.</hi> It was indeed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary deſcription, which ſome ancient Divines gave of juſtifying faith, calling it a <hi>full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the Love of God;</hi> and it may be much occaſioned by the heat of their oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the jejune faith of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who would make juſtifying faith to be <hi>aſſent to the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Word;</hi> it is likely their ſo deſcribing juſtifying faith, gave too much advantage to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:43194:127"/> the <hi>Antinomian</hi> notion, who to this day, will underſtand nothing of faith under <hi>ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophory,</hi> or full perſwaſion; but undoubtedly the <hi>act of juſtifying faith</hi> lyes lower, <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt, believing in him, relying upon him, committing our ſelves unto him, &amp;c.</hi> Nor can the other be the act of faith that juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, being not to be found, but in ſouls that are juſtified. For how can any ſoul whom God doth not love in Jeſus Chriſt, be fully (and juſtly) perſwaded of his love? Now <hi>the Lord loveth the righteous:</hi> until the ſoul be made righteous, through <hi>the imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt,</hi> it can be no object of divine love. That ſoul who hath opened his <hi>Will</hi> (through divine grace) to receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſt as tendered in the Goſpel, that is perſwaded to reſt, hang, truſt, rely, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit its ſelf to him, and him alone for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſoul truly believeth. Now this the ſoul doth that watcheth for Gods like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though it want ſenſible comforts.</p>
                  <p>Nay, this faith is <hi>ſtrong faith.</hi> It is the note of a late eminent ſervant of God, that <hi>faith is ſo much the ſtronger, by how much the fewer externals it needs to ſupport it.</hi> It was ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he was <hi>ſtrong in the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 18, 19, 20, 21.</note> 
                     <hi>faith, giving glory to God.</hi> Wherein did the ſtrength of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith appear? <hi>v. 18. He ſtaggered not at the promiſe;</hi> he <hi>againſt hope believed in hope;</hi> he had nothing of ſenſe to help his faith; his faith ſtood meerly upon the ſtrength of the word; he had a <hi>word of promiſe,</hi> and he <hi>ſtaggered not</hi> at the promiſe:
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:43194:128"/> he was ſo far from having any help to his faith, from ſenſe that he had all the diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and hinderance imaginable, the matter to be believed was, <hi>that God would give him a Son;</hi> for this he had the word of God. <hi>Thou ſhalt have a Son,</hi> ſaith God: his wife was paſt child-bearing; her womb was dead, inſomuch that ſhe <hi>laughed,</hi> when ſhe <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 12.</note> heard the promiſe, and ſaid, <hi>Shall I of a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bear a child, who am old? Abraham</hi> himſelf was beyond the age in which (ordinarily) children are begot; he was an hundred years old. But though he had no incouragement, but all imaginable diſcouragement from ſenſe, both on his own, and on his wives part, yet (ſaith the Apoſtle) he <hi>diſtruſted not;</hi> he <hi>ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered not at the promiſe through unbelief.</hi> Thus he was <hi>ſtrong in faith;</hi> and thus he gave <hi>glory to God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, giving him the honour of his <hi>power,</hi> of his <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, &amp;c.</hi> and this faith was <hi>imputed to him for righteouſneſs, v.</hi> 21, 22. Now if the weakeſt faith (being true) be ſufficient to carry the ſoul to Heaven, much more ſhall a <hi>ſtrong faith:</hi> ſuch a faith as that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the <hi>Father of the faithful</hi> do it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly, Will it not ſatisfie thee (Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian!) to tell thee <hi>thou art bleſſed?</hi> I have a good warrant to do that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 19. (They are the words of our Saviour) to <hi>Thomas, Thou haſt ſeen</hi> (ſaith our Lord) <hi>therefore thou haſt believed:</hi> bleſſed are they that have <hi>not ſeen, and yet believed.</hi> You are (even out of Chriſts mouth) more bleſſed believing,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:43194:128"/> when you do not ſee, than thoſe are who <hi>ſee,</hi> and therefore <hi>believe.</hi> But I ſhall enlarge no more upon this firſt ground of ſatisfaction for Chriſtians walking in the dark, and ſeeing no light. I proceed to the ſecond from the word conſidered, as it ſignifies to <hi>awake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It ought to ſatisfie Chriſtians walking in the dark, as to ſenſible conſolations, to conſider that when in the reſurrection they ſhall awake, they ſhall be ſatisfied with the likeneſs of God.</hi> There is nothing more needful for the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Propoſition, than I have already ſaid in the opening of ſome or other of the Propoſitions. In ſhort, the ſubſtance of what I intend, is this, that if it ſo pleaſeth God, that any child of his ſhould not only ſpend a great part of his life, without any ſenſible comforts, any witneſſings of the Spirit to his ſpirit: Nay, if the Lord ſhould call him to die without ſuch ſenſible evidences, yet he ought not to repine, or murmure againſt God; but to be ſilent before him, and truſt in him, chearfully conſidering, that though he dieth, he ſhall <hi>riſe again from the dead,</hi> and in the reſurrection he ſhall be fully, and abundantly ſatisfied with Gods full and glorious manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations of himſelf unto him, when he ſhall be bleſſed in the full and glorious enjoyment of God to all eternity.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>This is that which God hath agreed with us for;</hi> this is the penny for which he hath contracted. But of this I ſpake before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is <hi>infinitely more than any child of God hath merited,</hi> or <hi>can merit at Gods hand.</hi>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:43194:129"/> It will be a great piece of the work of the Saints in Heaven, to admire that rich and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite grace, which hath brought them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yea, though we ſhould never ſee Gods face till we come in Heaven; yet we ſhall ſee free grace magnified in bringing us thither at laſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, <hi>The ſatisfaction which the ſoul ſhall meet with when it comes in Heaven, will be infinitely more than will make us amends for all the diſſatisfactions all the hours of ſadneſs and darkneſs we have met with in this life:</hi> and infinitely more than will recompence us for all our <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> all our <hi>watchings</hi> and <hi>waitings</hi> for and upon God. For our duties, we value them above the Scripture rate, if we count them better than <hi>menſtrous cloths, and filthy raggs,</hi> or reckon that they deſerve any thing at the hand of God other than wrath, and ſhame, and confuſion of faith. And (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18. <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18.</note>

                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, You have heard that it is not <hi>repugnant to the juſtice and goodneſs of God, to ſuffer his child to fall aſleep in death, without a ſatisfaction with Gods likeneſs,</hi> without ſuch <hi>ſenſible comforts</hi> as others may have. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous; joy for the upright in</hi>

                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:43194:130"/> 
                     <hi>come, he is come.</hi> Sometimes again, the light of this life, goes out <hi>in obſcurity</hi> to them, and they go out of this world weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet carrying with them the precious ſeed of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> they ſhall return in the reſurrection rejoycing, and bring their ſheaves with them. This may ſerve to regulate our expectations, that they riſe not too high for diſpenſations not abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation, and to direct our <hi>charity,</hi> that we may not entertain uncharitable thoughts, nor paſs uncharitable cenſures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe whom we have ſeen in this life ſtrictly walking with God, yet not dying with ſenſible comforts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, The <hi>Children of God</hi> (as well as others) <hi>ſhall fall aſleep:</hi> Indeed their death is but a ſleep, and it ſhall not be a perpetual ſleep. Death ſhall taſte of them, but it <hi>ſhall not feed upon them. Lazarus ſleepeth</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) but <hi>I go to awake them.</hi> The children of God ſhall all ſleep; but the Lord will come to awake them; the laſt trump ſhall ſound, and thoſe who are dead in the graves, ſhall awake, and ſhall ariſe; they ſhall <hi>hear the voice of the Son of God, and live;</hi> their fleſh ſhall reſt, but it ſhall <hi>reſt in hope.</hi> The wicked alſo ſhall ſleep, and their bodies ſhall reſt, but in no hope of a better ſtate in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; it were well for them, if they might indeed ſleep a <hi>perpetual ſleep,</hi> and wake no more. Thus far you have been informed
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:43194:131"/> of the Lot of Gods people, and further of their great priviledge, when they awake in the reſurrection, to be fully and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied with the Lords likeneſs. But in order to their <hi>priviledge, you have alſo been informed of their duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Branch.</hi> At all times to keep on <hi>behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords face in righteouſneſs;</hi> in the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of an holy and innocent life and converſation; <hi>to keep a conſcience void of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence both towards God, and towards man;</hi> to be continually labouring <hi>to perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the fear of the Lord;</hi> to be much in prayer, much in the exerciſe of <hi>faith, hope, patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Eſpecially are they to take care that <hi>in their hours of darkneſs, they be not wanting to this duty.</hi> And further, doing this, they ought ſo far to be ſatisfied, as not to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, not to repine, not to think God deals hardly with them; but to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, rejoycing themſelves in this confidence, that when they ſhall awake in the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, they ſhall have what their heart could wiſh; they ſhall be abundantly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Lords likeneſs. Thus far what you have heard ſerveth you for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>

                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:43194:131"/> 
                     <hi>many poor ſouls who truly fear God, yet are not come up in this thing to their duty.</hi> How many do we meet with in the courſe of our Miniſtry, who, though Chriſt be in them, <hi>the hopes of glory;</hi> though they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny what God hath done for their ſouls; their ſouls tell them; they have put their truſt in God, and committed themſelves to the arm of <hi>everlaſting righteouſneſs;</hi> they dare not knowingly offend God, but make it their buſineſs, and herein exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to keep a conſcience void of offence, both towards God and man; yet becauſe poſſibly at preſent they have not thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible reflections, which others have and they deſire, they cannot be ſatisfied, but are ready to complain, and murmure; and like a teachy child, to throw away, and deſpiſe all they have, becauſe they cannot obtain this which they ſo paſſionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; they can ſee no ground of hope, they are perſwaded, that at laſt they ſhall go to Hell, and one day periſh with all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; they can find no <hi>witneſſings,</hi> no <hi>ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of Gods Spirit. How often do we hear theſe, and ſuch like ſad expreſſions from them? But Chriſtians, I beſeech you conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What God ſaid to <hi>Jonah, Do you well to be angry?</hi> do you well to repine and murmure? <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 25. 3. prayes <hi>they might be aſhamed who are tranſgreſſours</hi> without a cauſe: Are you not tranſgreſſours
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:43194:132"/> without a cauſe? hath not God given you more than you have earned? hath he not given you the penny you contracted with him for? why are you angry then? why diſcontented? why lift you up your voice againſt Heaven?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, <hi>How many thouſands are there in the world, who have</hi> (as creatures) <hi>as much claim to God as you, for whom the Lord hath not done ſo much for as he hath done for you:</hi> He hath given them portions in this life, and hath ſent them away; they have pleaſure, riches, honours, &amp;c. but no faith, no hope, nothing of grace, no intereſt in Chriſt; they are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, periſhing to all eternity: You only want a ſpiritual banquet; the moſt want ſpiritual bread, yet creatures under the ſame natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral capacity that you are.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though in one ſenſe <hi>you be not ſealed;</hi> yet in another ſenſe you are <hi>ſealed.</hi> You read in Scripture of the <hi>ſealing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 13. chap. 4. 30. 2 Cor. 1. 22. <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 13. 4. 30. 2 Cor. 1. 22.</note> We uſually interpret thoſe texts of <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> becauſe <hi>ſeals are uſed for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> But poſſibly there is another ſenſe as agreeable to the mind of the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>A ſeal</hi> (you know) <hi>leaveth the ſignature or impreſſion of it upon the wax;</hi> the wax hath the image of the ſeal upon it. The Lords renewing and ſtamping his Image upon the ſoul, is a <hi>ſealing of it to the day of Adoption.</hi> There is a ſeal of <hi>Regeneration</hi>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:43194:132"/> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> as well as a <hi>ſeal</hi> of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance;</hi> and though the latter ſealing be infinitely ſweet, and pleaſant to the ſoul; yet the former is that which fitteth us for the Kingdom of Heaven; <hi>Without holineſs no man can ſee God.</hi> Is there not as much (think you) of the operation of the Spirit ſeen in <hi>ſanctifying, quickening, ſtrengthening</hi> a ſoul, as in <hi>comforting</hi> it, and <hi>aſſuring</hi> it of ſalvation? Is it our great miſtake that we will look upon nothing as the fruit of the Spirit, but <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>peace;</hi> certainly the renewing and ſanctifying of the ſoul is as much the operation of the Spirit; and the ſtrengthening and quickening of the ſoul, in the performance of duty, or in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of corruption, is as much the fruit of the Spirit in the ſoul, as comforting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing the ſoul is.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If God hath thus far inabled you, <hi>viz.</hi> to behold his face in righteouſneſs, and to watch for his likeneſs, he hath given you <hi>the neceſſaries of ſalvation,</hi> the things which <hi>accompany ſalvation.</hi> What you want, is only what a ſoul may want, and yet get to Heaven. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> they are the neceſſaries to ſalvation: a ſoul may go to Heaven without <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Peace;</hi> without <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> there is no ſalvation. When God hath given you the bread of life, have you not reaſon to be ſatisfied? Though you want that banquet with which he ſometimes
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:43194:133"/> is pleaſed to entertain the ſouls of his people?</p>
                  <p>The Example of this rare and eminent ſervant of God, might have at once (as to this thing) have inſtructed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved many unthankful, diſcontented, and repining Chriſtians. It had pleaſed the Lord to ſtrip her naked of moſt of her creature comforts; he had ſent ſuch meſſengers as he ſent to <hi>Job,</hi> to her, one after another, till at laſt death came to aſſure her all (as to this life) was gone; ſhe was under a ſad and inexpreſſible trial of affliction: It is true in this ſad and afflicted ſtate as to her outward concerns, ſhe had her lived in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, ſome glimmerings of divine light: ſometimes <hi>Joy</hi> came over night, but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row came again in the morning; the clouds returned after rain. That word, <hi>Col. 1. 27. Chriſt in you the hope of Glory,</hi> often refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her; but her adverſary was buſie, her comforts inconſtant, her aſſurance little; yet ſhe <hi>lived in hope,</hi> and bleſſed God, and was thankful: ſhe endured violent pains, and in her ſuffering acted a ſtrong ſaith; and in the ſaddeſt diſtempers would cry out, <hi>Oh Sir, Satan would have me let go my hold on Chriſt, but I will truſt in God till I die: Though he kills me, yet I will truſt in him; tell me I pray</hi> (Sir) <hi>may I not?</hi> She died in hope: her very laſt words were <hi>I hope, I hope;</hi> to make good that of the wiſe man; that <hi>the righteous man hath hope
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:43194:133"/> in his death;</hi> and by hope I doubt not but ſhe is <hi>ſaved,</hi> and now ſeeing what ſhe hoped, and with ſo great patience waited for. Heark and be aſhamed, thou mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and unthankful Chriſtian, that art not ſo much as ſhe diſadvantaged from the providence of God, yet canſt not tell how to be ſilent, becauſe thou wanteſt conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory manifeſtations.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. As to our ſelves, <hi>concerning our dark hours.</hi> The people of God are ordinarily very <hi>jeolous</hi> of their Saviours love, and very <hi>ſuſpicious</hi> of their own <hi>ſincerity;</hi> they know not how to truſt as the one, nor be confident as to the other, without the incouragement of comfortable reflections; nor how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they ſhall go to Heaven, if they go not to it in the fight of it. The wiſe man ſaith, a man knoweth not <hi>love</hi> nor <hi>hatred, by all that is before him in this life;</hi> ſo that none ought to determine of himſelf in this caſe, from any <hi>external diſpenſatious of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi> A Chriſtian may be poor, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and yet a favourite of God; and as he ought not to judge himſelf from theſe more external diſpenſations; ſo neither ought he to judge himſelf from the want
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:43194:134"/> of ſenſible manifeſtations to his inward man. The child of God may walk in darkneſs: <hi>Job, David, Heman, Aſaph;</hi> all had their dark hours: if therefore that be our lot, yet this is no ground of diſcouragement to us; no ground for any ſad concluſion againſt our ſouls, as to their beſt intereſts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, what we have heard, affords us a great <hi>comfort againſt the fear of death.</hi> The Scripture calleth death, <hi>The King of terrours.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Job 18. 14.</note> And the Apoſtle ſaith, that even Gods people (through the fear of it) <hi>are all their life time</hi>

                     <hi>ſubject to bondage.</hi> It is the common portion of all the Sons of men. <hi>It is appointed for all men once to die;</hi> and it is our great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to arm our ſelves againſt the fears of it: you have heard from the former diſcourſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That death is but a ſleep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That it is not a perpetual ſleep,</hi> but a ſleep from which we ſhall awake.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That at our awaking out of that ſleep,</hi> we ſhall be ſatisfied with Gods likeneſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay (firſt) <hi>death is but a ſleep.</hi> It is not an <hi>annihilation</hi> of a man, that miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of it make it terrible to a man in his natural capacity. It is not (to the child of God) <hi>the ſecuring of a perſon</hi> to the Judgement of the great day. In this notion unbelievers have reaſon to conſider it, what is it then? It is but a <hi>ſleep.</hi> This gentle no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death, ſhould take the terrour of it off our ſpirits: no man is afraid to go to ſleep; why ſhould we be more afraid to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:43194:134"/> die but for unbelief and a reproving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Were it indeed a <hi>perpetual ſleep,</hi> there would be leſs of relief in it; but there ſhall be an <hi>awaking out of this ſleep:</hi> though the night be long, there ſhall be a morning. This doctrine of the Reſurrection is indeed the great argument of comfort againſt death. The Apoſtle having mentioned it to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> to relieve them as to their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for their friends aſleep in the Lord, concludes, wherefore <hi>comfort your ſolves with theſe words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But yet the <hi>feaſt to which we ſhall awake in the Reſurrection,</hi> is of a further conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to relieve us under diſturbances of this nature. This was that which cleared the <hi>Martyr,</hi> that <hi>although he had an ill Supper, he ſhould have a good breakfaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſleep of death, is not like the ſleep the Prophet ſpeaks of. When a man dreams he is at a feaſt, and when he awaketh behold he is an hungry. Indeed there is no dreaming in this ſleep; but when the child of God awaketh from it in the reſurrection, he ſhall awake to a feaſt, not an imaginary, but a real feaſt, where he ſhall be filled with the likeneſs of God to all eternity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Branch.</hi> Laſtly, What we have heard adminiſters <hi>great conſolation to ſuch as mourn for their friends fallen aſleep in the Lord.</hi> Have we had any friends, who have made it their

They have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed died, breathing and thirſting after God, hoping and truſting in God, and quietly committing their ſelves unto him; but not being able to ſay, <hi>Lo this is my God, I have waited for him; this is my God, I have waited for him; I will rejoyce and be glad in his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> I ſay, have we known any ſo? have we had at any time any ſuch friends, under ſuch circumſtances? poſſibly we have been troubled, and have had ſad thoughts for them; but there is no reaſon; what though they have <hi>fallen aſleep,</hi> they <hi>ſhall awake;</hi> what though they fell aſleep not <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> they ſhall <hi>be ſatisfied with the Lords likeneſs,</hi> when they awake, <hi>they ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> There are thouſands that die without any ſuch troubled thoughts.

Mourn for looſe walking Profeſſors, who have lived here without any fear of God, or any care to pleaſe God; and yet when they die, have talkt of full perſwaſions, and been full of preſumptuous confidences; but be not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for holy and gracious ſouls, whoſe lives have been full of faith and holineſs: though it may be they have had their fears while they lived, and a dark hour when they died hath clouded them, yet doubt not of them; mourn not for them; thoſe perſons have not died without hope; do not you mourn as thoſe without hope; their ſalvation is certain, whether it hath been aſcertained to them, or no, hoping in God, committing their ſouls unto God, truſting in him, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, they ſhall not be aſhamed: trouble not your ſelves for them; though <hi>they fall, they ſhall riſe;</hi> though they ſleep, they ſhall awake, though through a too much love-jealouſie, or through the wiſe diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God; when they fell aſleep, they were unſatisfied; yet when in the reſurrection

The Lord will not ſpare him, but then the anger of the Lord, and his jealouſie, ſhall ſmoak againſt that man, and all the curſes that are written in this Book, ſhall be upon him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under Heaven, and the Lord ſhall ſeparate him to evil, out of all the tribes of Iſrael, according to all the curſes of the Covenant, that are written in this Book of the Law, &amp;c.</hi> None can hope for the ſavour of God here or hereafter, but thoſe only who are clothed with the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, and who live an holy and righteous converſation before God, declining all manner of ſin and wickedneſs, and doing the whole will of God; and ſuch who in this courſe of life (through the grace of God

                  <p>Others indeed may pretend that they hope; but indeed, could you look into the ſecrets of their ſouls, you would find them without any true hope, not attending to the eternal concerns of their ſouls, while they are in health and at liberty, they are perfectly careleſs, neither hope nor fear much: when God alarums them with a conviction, a terrour of conſcience, or a ſickneſs, that looks as if it would determine their daies, then they begin to conſider; and as drowing men lay hold of every ruſh, every twig, never conſidering whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it hath in it ſtrength enough to bear them; they lay hold upon every thing as a ground of hope. <hi>God made them,</hi> and therefore they hope he will not damn them, (as if <hi>Hell</hi> were prepared for none.)

That they would return from the vanity of their courſes unto God, and labour for a <hi>ſtate of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> There are many Arguments in Scripture to inforce this. <hi>The unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9. <hi>The righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. 11. But I ſhall only inſiſt upon what I find in the text. You have heard what I mean by righteouſneſs, and may eaſily apply what I have already ſaid, to inform you what it is to be in a ſtate of righteouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To be clothed with the righteouſneſs of him who is the Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi>

Two great Arguments to inforce this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation may be drawn from my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is the only way to <hi>behold the Lords face.</hi> No way to behold Gods face in this life, but <hi>in righteouſneſs.</hi> No hopes hereafter to <hi>behold his face in glory, but in righteouſneſs.</hi> Men may pleaſe themſelves with <hi>dreams,</hi> and flatter themſelves with <hi>vain hopes;</hi> but no man in this life ſeeth any thing of God; no man enjoyeth any thing of God but the righteous man. <hi>The Lord heareth not</hi>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:43194:138"/> 
                     <hi>ſinners;</hi> the Lord accepteth not the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous perſon; nor can any (without righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs) ever hope to behold the face of the Lord in glory. Thoſe who are not clothed with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt ſhall indeed behold the Lords face in the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but it ſhall be his angry face; and it ſhall be againſt their will that they behold the Lords face then; <hi>for they ſhall hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in mountains, and rocks, and dens, and ſhall cry to the mountains, and to the rocks to fall on them, and to hide them from him who ſitteth on the Throne.</hi> They indeed ſhall be filled, but it ſhall be with their own waies, (for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of their hands ſhall be given them) and with the Lords wrath, and vengeance on them for their ſins; for this they ſhall have at the Lords hand; they ſhall <hi>lye down in ſorrow.</hi> Thoſe alone, who while they lived, beheld the face of God in righteouſneſs, ſhall enjoy any thing of God here, or in the life which is to come. They only ſhall hear that bleſſed ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Come you bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you.</hi> This is my firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is no ſmall thing <hi>that righteous perſons have enough in this life, even in their darkeſt hours, to give them ſatisfaction.</hi> A ſinner hath not enough when he is at the fulleſt, to give him a ſatisfaction; his <hi>eye</hi> (even then) <hi>will not be ſatisfied with ſeeing; nor his ear with hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; nor his hand with griping;</hi> he will never have enough: yet in his life he takes his

                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Branch.</hi> Laſtly, What you have heard may be of uſe to perſwade you that fear the Lord, to <hi>your duties under the ecclipſes of divine love.</hi> It is the great buſineſs of a Chriſtian to ſtudy, and know, and practiſe what is his duty

                  <p>I Shall not undertake the pourtraiture of this excellent Lady from head to foot; partly becauſe the circumſtances of her <hi>birth, breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>education,</hi> were much the ſame with her elder Siſters, whoſe Copy I have given more fully, ſo as I ſhould but repeat the ſame things again; partly becauſe indeed, till the latter two years of her life, ſhe was not at all known to me; and partly becauſe that part of her life was it alone, wherein ſhe made not her ſelf known to the world.</p>
                  <p>It was about the firſt day of <hi>April, anno</hi> 1650. that her Lap (having received an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation from her noble Siſter (whom we have formerly in this treatiſe diſcourſed of) came to ſpend the retired part of her life with her at <hi>Chaplifield-houſe</hi> in <hi>Norwich.</hi> Her time of health with us was about three quarters of a year; the other was her dying time.</p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:43194:140"/>
                  <p>I will ſuppoſe that none who knew her derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> will think ſhe was not ſubject to like paſſions and infirmities with others of the ſame blood: but as theſe were not ſuch, but were conſiſtent enough with eminent degrees of grace; ſo neither were they her pleaſure, but her burthen. And the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>we have an High</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Prieſt, who can have compaſſion upon our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, being touched with a feeling of them; having been in all points tempted like as we are, only without ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall only copy out this excellent ſervant of God, ſo far, as the abundant grace of God appeared in her, for <hi>our conſolation,</hi> and <hi>our imitation</hi> of her example.</p>
                  <p>Six things I obſerved in her, in the daies of her health, ſpeaking much of the grace of God beſtowed on her.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt was her <hi>chearful, quiet, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubmiſſion to Divine Providence.</hi> I have not known (hardly read of any, <hi>Job</hi> alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) whom the Lord was pleaſed to blow upon with a ſeries of ſharper providences, than he did upon this eminent Lady; he had even made her a mark for all his arrows: I have often thought her afflicted condition much parallel to that of <hi>Job;</hi> he had great <hi>ſubſtance, dear relations,</hi> an <hi>healthful body,</hi> and in a moment loſt the comfort of them all.</p>
                  <p>This noble <hi>Lady</hi> was removed from the great plenty of her Fathers houſe, by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, to <hi>William Courten,</hi> Son and her of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:43194:141"/> Sir <hi>William Courten,</hi> with whom ſhe enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a plenteous eſtate, inferiour to few ſubjects of <hi>England; Silver was with her as duſt, and as the ſtones of the field.</hi> He gave her an Husband, who was to her the <hi>man of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, the delight of her eyes,</hi> and as the <hi>breath of her noſtrils,</hi> he bleſſed them both with a numerous off ſpring: Thus he had made her mountain to ſtand ſtrong; and in this height of her proſperity, ſhe began to ſay, <hi>I ſhall never be moved.</hi> But it was not long before the Lord hid the face of his providence from her, and <hi>ſhe was troubled.</hi> Firſt he <hi>ſtrips off her branches,</hi> taking away one child after another, until only <hi>one Son,</hi> and <hi>one Daughter</hi> were left unto her. Then he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth an <hi>Eaſt-wind</hi> to blow upon her eſtate, ſcattering, and breaking the ſhips that went for treaſures to the <hi>Indies,</hi> every year bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ſad tydings or other of this nature, until the Lord had ſtript her naked; and her deareſt Husband was not only ruined as to his whole eſtate, but involved in an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable debt; and this noble <hi>Lady,</hi> who lately equalized her greateſt friends, in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the good things of this life, became into a condition of dependance upon them, and through the violence of men, is ſeparated from her <hi>deareſt relation,</hi> who was now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained in a remote Land to ſeek himſelf a City of Refuge, and to ſecure her ſelf from the ſnare of an oath (which ſhe judged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural) it was, that ſhe retired to her
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:43194:141"/> noble Siſter at <hi>Norwich;</hi> yet in all this <hi>ſhe charged not God fooliſhly:</hi> The Lord had given, and the Lord had taken, and <hi>ſhe bleſſed the Name of the Lord;</hi> with a meek and quiet ſpirit humbly kiſſing the Rod of God that was upon her, and <hi>holding her peace, becauſe it was the Lords doing,</hi> who ſhe freely acknowledged might do with <hi>her</hi> and <hi>hers, what he pleaſed;</hi> and ſhe could not ſay unto him, <hi>what doſt thou?</hi> Yea not only ſo, but taken up with the admiration of the goodneſs of God to her, ſeen in the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her noble friends to ſhew kindneſs to her and her remaining children in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſtate; and much more affected with this, than with any trouble for <hi>Gods</hi> ſeverer diſpenſations to her. I have often heard her ſay, <hi>That ſhe now ſaw more of the goodneſs of God in one ten pounds which a friend ſent her, and could better acknowledge it, than ſhe did before in thoſe many thouſands which were her own.</hi> Nay, when after all this, it pleaſed the Lord to return upon her, and to lay his hand upon her <hi>skin</hi> and <hi>fleſh,</hi> viſiting her with a tormenting, incurable diſeaſe; yet ſhe laid her hand upon her mouth; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged the Lords juſtice, but alſo admired his mercy; and if at any time it pleaſed God to give her any reſpiration from her tormenting pains, how ſtraightened was her tongue in the expreſſing the thankfulneſs of her heart? how did praiſe wait in her thankful ſoul for God? Sometimes indeed
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:43194:142"/> I ſaw her troubled at Gods more external diſpenſations to her; and that to a degree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what could be called a juſt ſenſe of them; but upon diſcourſe with her, I conſtantly found the cauſe. Either a <hi>bitter reflection</hi> upon the <hi>influence,</hi> which the ſad providence of God, blaſting her dear Husbands eſtate, had upon many other perſons and families which ſhe could never think on without tears, and which ſhe would often profeſs more troubled her, than her own, her deareſt husbands and childrens concerns: Or elſe <hi>ſome fears heightened in her by the advantage her ſubtil adverſary took of her afflicted ſtate,</hi> leſt the Rod of God ſhould be an indication of his wrath; the dread of which infinitely more troubled her, than her low condition, as to the comforts of this life, upon which the Lord had taught her to ſet a very cheap valuation. Verily it hath often ſtartled me, to ſuppoſe my ſoul in her ſouls ſtead, and to think what I ſhould have been, under ſuch diſpenſations, as it pleaſed God to meaſure out to her, which ſhe imbraced with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous degrees of meekneſs and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing eminently conſpicuous in this Excellent <hi>Lady,</hi> was, <hi>her exceeding ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of conſcience, and watchful jealouſie over her own heart.</hi> It would have made a good Chriſtian to have ſuſpected himſelf to have ſeen her ſcrupuloſity of every action, how wary ſhe was in ſetting every foot, how
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:43194:142"/> afraid of the leaſt ſin againſt God; ſhe often diſcovered unto me (living with her under the ſame roof) the ſtate of her ſoul, what ſhe found, what ſhe wanted, what ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon, what grievances, and what comforts at any time ſhe had; but ſcarce ever did it without adjuring me to be ſaithful unto her, in telling her what I judged of her condition in reference to eternity: indeed the hearing her ſtrictly charging me not to flatter her, but to deal faithfully with her, hath often made me tremble, leſt through temptation or weakneſs, I ſhould fall ſhort of my duty to her. Indeed, ſhe was over-jealous, and through fear of ſin, would ſometime ſcruple what was her duty, yea her greateſt duty: How often did I hear from her theſe words?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh Sir, Satan is very buſie, he would have me let go my hold on my dear Saviour; but I am reſolved to keep it until I die; Sir, may I not? I beſeech you tell me if you think I may not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third thing was, <hi>her admirable love to publick Ordinances.</hi> She might truly ſay with <hi>David, How amiable are thy Tabernacles O Lord of Hoſts?</hi> This very thing was her great motive to chuſe her dear Siſters family for the place of her receſs, and rejoyce in it, by reaſon of the private Chapel, where the Ordinances of God were ordinarily diſpenſed, and ſhe could attend them without any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick notice taken of her (as beſt ſuited her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition) ſhe was never either abſent
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:43194:143"/> from, or tardy at a Sermon, when by reaſon of the prevailing of her bodily diſtempers, ſhe could not go down the ſtairs, ſhe choſe rather to be carried down, than to miſs the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, till her Phyſicians advice reſtrained her: Nor was her carriage at Religious exerciſes leſs exemplary; her outward poſture diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with what reverence and trembling ſhe heard the holy Word of God; ſhe received the Word of God <hi>as the Word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Her ſecret communion with God was as remarkable.</hi> Her way was not to ſet a trumpet to her mouth, when ſhe went to her devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but whatever company was in the houſe, ſhe was exceeding certain to her hours of ſecret prayer; and in her diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually commended it, as that by which a Chriſtian comes beſt to underſtand his own heart; and by her countenance and diſcourſe, when ſhe came from her cloſet, it was eaſie for us who converſed with her, to judge what ſhe had been doing: ſhe was much in prayer, much in tears, much in reading the holy Scriptures, in reading over good books, and notes of Sermons, which her ſelf had taken; and (as we could judge by her diſcourſe) much in the application of what ſhe read to her own ſoul, and examining her heart by them. Thus you have her copy towards God, though the lineaments of her perfections in this are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly drawn, and much is left to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. I omit any diſcourſe of her intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual and moral virtues; ſhe was a Lady of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:43194:143"/> great knowledge, prudence, humility, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, gravity and ſobriety of behaviour, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, courteſie, nobleneſs of ſpirit, &amp;c. but my deſign is to ſhew you how far ſhe was an excellent Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A fifth thing remarkable in her, was, her <hi>well ordered tender love to her deareſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi> None could by the dejection of her countenance have known that the providence of God had blown croſs upon her, had not ſome ſad thoughts for the exiled ſtate of her dear Husband, ſometimes darkened her joy, and diſturbed her thoughts; nor was her love ſeen only in fond expreſſions, and a fondneſs of behaviour, in which the love of the moſt evaporates. Her husband and childrens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were exceeding dear to her; but their ſouls were more exceeding dear: She was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with no Chriſtian, whom ſhe did not importune for prayers for her dear huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and children. I remember it was her great requeſt to me in a great ſickneſs which ſhe had about a year before ſhe died, when we thought ſhe had received the ſentence of death, <hi>That I would not in any prayers forget her husband and children when ſhe ſhould ceaſe to be;</hi> for her husband, <hi>that God would be with him, and keep him from the temptations and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that Popiſh Country into which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God had driven him:</hi> And for her children, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt might be formed in them.</hi> It was the great ambition of this <hi>Elect Lady,</hi> that her children might be found
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:43194:144"/> 
                     <hi>walking in the Truth;</hi> this was the <hi>portion ſhe deſired for them;</hi> this the treaſure, even a <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Heaven, where moth could not corrupt, nor thief break through nor ſteal.</hi> How far it pleaſed God to hear her, her worthy and only Son (yet ſurviving) being at that time in his childhood) is a living teſtimony, who, as by his religious and virtuous diſpoſition, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates that the prayers of his Mother were not ineffectual for him, nor <hi>the Law of his Mother forgotten by him:</hi> So having ſince the death both of his Mother and Father vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited <hi>Italy</hi> (where his Father died) is able to ſatisfie the world, that his Father died in the communion of the <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the impudent aſſertions of ſome Popelings amongſt us) being ſo kept by the power of God; that although he daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with perſons of that Religion, yet they were able to prevail nothing with him; but that he died in a perfect abomination of the <hi>ſuperſtitious vanities</hi> of that fond Religion, and left with his friend there, a perfect te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of it to be communicated to his Son (as it was accordingly) and if there were no other, yet their denial of him a room amongſt them for a burial-place, and inforcing his friends to bury him in the place of <hi>their Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> (of which his ſurviving Son can teſtifie) is a teſtimony beyond the contradiction of any, unleſs ſuch whoſe tongues are leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, becauſe they reſolve to keep them under no government of Truth.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:43194:144"/>6. A ſixth thing remarkable in this <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Lady,</hi> was, <hi>her faithfulneſs to her friend:</hi> Not an ordinary faithfulneſs ſeen in keeping counſels, and concealing ſeerets, in ordinary help and aſſiſtance, but a <hi>ſpiritual faithfulneſs,</hi> diſcerned in a prudent admoniſhing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving her friends, <hi>not ſuffering ſin upon them;</hi> a piece of faithfulneſs exceeding rare in this flattering age: nor in this would ſhe ſpare her deareſt relations, were her affection to them never ſo great, her obligations never ſo many, ſhe truly judged that her affections were thus beſt ſhewn, her obligations thus beſt diſcharged, by ſaving their ſouls from death; remembring that of <hi>Solomon; As an ear-ring of gold, and as an ornament of fine gold; ſo is a wiſe reproof upon an obedient ear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whoſo looked wiſtly upon her in the daies of her liberty, ſaw theſe chains about her neck, theſe jewels of grace adorning her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, her carriage was <hi>grave and ſober,</hi> yet innocently <hi>facete</hi> and <hi>chearful.</hi> The <hi>noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her ſpirit</hi> diſcovered it ſelf in a ſweet <hi>affability</hi> and <hi>courteſie</hi> of behaviour towards all, an admiſſion of perſons far beneath her quality, to a great freedom of converſe with her, eſpecially if they were ſuch as <hi>feared God,</hi> and whom ſhe diſcerned to have any <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in his waies.</hi> As God had indued her with a rare degree of knowledge, a piercing wit, and a notable judgement, and other rare parts and indowments; ſo it was her conſtant buſineſs to make an improvement of them for
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:43194:145"/> his glory. Her delight was in the Book of God, in that ſhe read, in that ſhe meditated night and day. The hours ſhe ſpent out of her cloſet, not in Publick Ordinances (which were not many) were uſually ſpent by her in diſcourſes tending to edification; nor was ſhe ever more in her element, than when by debate with others ſhe was ſifting out ſome truth, in order to the further information of her judgement, or guidance of her practice: ſhe was impatient of hearing what ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived was contrary to truth, or which gave way to the leaſt ſin againſt God; which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhewed, that a zeal for God had eaten her up; though poſſibly ſometimes her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion betrayed her to ſome failing, through ſome miſapprehenſions from which ſhe could not be concluded free, being a Daughter of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſubject to like infirmities with others.</p>
                  <p>Thus, for ſome few months, ſhe went out, and came in with us, and we began to bleſs our ſelves in the providence of God, who had ſent amongſt us ſo eminent an example of holineſs to go before us, and to be an helper to us in the waies of God. But our wiſe God would let us know that we rejoyced in a gourd that might <hi>go down in a night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To make her a perfect pattern of his free grace; he who in his wiſdom had already taken away the moſt of her children, bereaved her of the comfort of her deareſt yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow, and ſtript her naked of her worldly affluences, returns again, and viſits her
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:43194:145"/> perſon with his ſevere afflicting hand.</p>
                  <p>The nature of her diſtemper was ſuch as it at firſt confined her to her chamber, and at once deprived her both of her health, and what ſhe valued far more, her ordinary liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of enjoying God in his Publick Ordinances: yet for ſeveral months, ſhe was not a cloſe priſoner, but had the liberty of her chamber, an ability to diſcourſe with her friends, and enjoyed much freedom in family-communion with God, and her more ſecret communion with him.</p>
                  <p>But this was not enough to ſatisfie her thirſty ſoul; ſhe would now be often crying out, <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles O God? my ſoul longeth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of God. My heart and my fleſh cryeth out for the living God. The Sparrow hath found an houſe, and the Swallow a neſt; where ſhe might lay her young, even thine Altars O Lord of Hoſts my King, my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During the time of this confinement to her chamber, ſhe had little (as before) to divert her thoughts from a too much poring upon Gods ſad diſpenſations to her; her affliction alſo was now doubled through want of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinances; her bodily diſtemperature daily increaſed upon her: ſhe very ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ldom heard from her Husband; and what ſhe heard, was but ſad tydings, adding ſtill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to affliction, one ſorrow to another. This indeed was a fit time for our grand adverſary, to play his game; and he who is
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:43194:146"/> watchful enough upon all opportunities to ruine our ſouls, could not miſs ſo fair a one as was here offered. While ſhe was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>in the wilderneſs of ſolitude and affliction.</hi> the tempter came; and even from this time to her dying day, he inceſſantly followed her with ſucceſſive temptations, if it had been poſſible to have baffled her ſaith and hope in God.</p>
                  <p>You read in Scripture of Satans <hi>Depths, Devices, Methods:</hi> Many a deviſe he uſed; into many a depth he dived: various were the methods he practiſed, for the final ruine of this rare and excellent perſon; but it was not poſſible to deſtroy her Elect ſoul for which Chriſt had died.</p>
                  <p>Have you ſeen or read of the General of an Army, ſighting a potent and a ſubtil ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, how he gains his ground by inches; now gains, and by and by loſeth what he hath got, being forced to give the ground he had gained; and again to diſpute for what he was once poſſeſſed of: Have you ſeen the adverſary inforced to retreat; but retreating to another work, and being forced from that, retreating to a third: this you might have ſeen in this ſpiritual fight betwixt this cminent Lady, and the great Dragon.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Tempt.</hi> Her firſt <hi>Temptation was, to doubt of Gods love, and to diſtruſt him for her eternal ſalvation, becauſe of Gods ſad diſpenſations to her.</hi> This was one of Satans weakeſt batteries,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:43194:146"/> yet ſo managed and advantaged with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of her trials, that for ſome weeks ſhe had much ado to grapple with her adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary here. I having the advantage of frequent diſcourſe with her Ladiſhip, and perceiving the ſtone upon which ſhe ſtumbled, indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured her aſſiſtance, partly remembring her,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, That none can judge of <hi>love or hate by all that is before him:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9. 1.</note> For it may fall out alike to him that is <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually wiſe,</hi> and to him that is <hi>ſpiritually a fool.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Partly by minding her of what the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That God chaſteneth whom he</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Partly arguing thus with her; If af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions be tokens of <hi>divine wrath,</hi> then <hi>health</hi> and <hi>proſperity</hi> are <hi>ſigns of divine love,</hi> which is evidently ſalfe.</p>

                     </gap>ly by <hi>remembring her of the many examples of Gods children in Scripture,</hi> to whom God had wrung out bitter waters in a full cup; who yet at that time when they were ſo afflicted, were undoubtedly beloved of God, and exceeding precious in his eyes. Such were <hi>Joſeph, David, Job, Daniel,</hi> and many others recorded in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. With theſe, and ſuch like Arguments I had ſatisfied her ſanctified reaſon and judgement, and thought I ſhould have heard no more of this temptation. But ſoon
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:43194:147"/> after it was inforced. Two things ſhe had to ſay:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The greatneſs of her affliction ſpake more than a chaſtiſement with a rod;</hi> ſhe was ſcourged with Scorpions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lords multiplying afflictions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating ſad Providences to her, ſeemed to argue that he had a quarrel againſt her:</hi> Why elſe ſhould he return upon her body, when he had ſerved an execution upon all ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. To this I replied;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the afflictions of Gods people are not called cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>iſements, becauſe they are l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ght or little; but becauſe they come from the hand of a gracious Father, not as legal demands of ſatisfaction to divine Juſtice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, becauſe they flow from a principle of love, not of wrath, and are deſigned to a gracious end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That for the multitude of them: <hi>Job</hi> had as many, yet was a perſon ſingularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God; and one of whom God gave teſtimony, that there was <hi>not one like him in all the Eaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That as the afflictions of <hi>Job</hi> were of divers hands, and exceeding heavy; ſo the ſucceſſion of them was much like to hers. God firſt took away his children, then his eſtate; and laſt of all, let looſe Satan upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and gave him a liberty to tempt him.</p>
                  <p>With theſe, and ſuch like conſiderations, I endeavoured to arm her againſt this fiery dart; at laſt it pleaſed him, <hi>who was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:43194:147"/> tempted, that he might be able to ſuccour thoſe that were tempted;</hi> by his mighty power to lift her over this ſtone of ſtumbling, and ſhe became fully ſatisfied, that ſhe could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the greatneſs, nor multitude of her trials, conclude any thing againſt the love of God to her.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Tempt. If during her afflictions ſhe did not alſo want the inward conſolations of the holy Spirit;</hi> but alas! (ſaith ſhe) I have no inward aſſurance of Gods love; no ſenſible conſolations, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Perceiving that her adverſary had betaken himſelf to a new battery, I endeavoured to direct her in the uſe of the Armour of God, for the rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lling of his darts thrown from hence, by offering to her conſideration,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That even Gods deareſt children have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wanted theſe influences of the Spirit:</hi> What elſe made <hi>David</hi> cry out, When wilt thou comfort me? and <hi>veſtor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>To this ſhe replied, That it was true; but ſurely if ſhe indeed had any intereſt in God, he would not hide himſelf from one ſo preſſed with affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ctions as ſhe was. God indeed might thus try his children, in health and at liberty; but would a tender Father ſo hide himſelf from ſo diſtreſſed and a
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:43194:148"/> dying child. This was hard to imagine of God who is <hi>Love.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>I replied to this purpoſe, That ſenſible conſolations were not the neceſſaries of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. 2. That the love of God to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is far more ſeen in giving the ſoul ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, than accommodating it with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities. 3. That God is no where in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture tyed by his promiſe to Saints, for the comforts of aſſurance to be given them in at this or that hour. 4. That it is a very great miſtake in Chriſtians, to judge they want the manifeſtations of the Spirit, becauſe they want theſe conſolatory reflections; for the Spirit manifeſteth it ſelf in the ſoul, as well by the influences of <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> and <hi>quickening,</hi> as comforting grace, and the witneſſings of it. That <hi>David</hi> was become <hi>like a bottle in the ſmoke, that his eyes failed for Gods Word,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>When wilt thou comfort me?</hi> Pſal. 119. 82, 83. yet he was at that time Gods child; yea, <hi>the man according to his heart.</hi> That <hi>Job</hi> alſo (as might be gathered from ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in his Book) often wanted theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible manifeſtations; at laſt I commended a Sermon upon that ſubject to her; after the reading of which, her Spirit was more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and ſhe ſatisfied, that if ſhe could but find the ſtrengthening and quickening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of divine grace, ſhe had no reaſon for want of ſenſible conſolations to conclude againſt her ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:43194:148"/>3 <hi>Tempt.</hi> Satan perceiving this fiery dart well nigh quenched, betakes him again to his quiver for another arrow: his next <hi>device</hi> was to perſwade her that ſhe wanted alſo <hi>the ſtrengthening grace of God;</hi> ſoon after I heard her ſpeaking to this ſenſe;</p>
                  <q>'Tis true (Sir) if I could but find the grace of God ſtrengthening me unto duty, againſt ſin, I think I ought not to caſt away my hope, though I do want aſſurance; that I am my Beloveds, and my Beloved mine; but alas I want this!

                  <p>Obſerving the ſubtilty of this crafty adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to perſwade her from ſome partial weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and thoſe alſo much occaſioned from bodily diſtempers, that ſhe wholly wanted the workings of the Spirit of Grace; I accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly applied my ſelf to her.</p>
                  <p>She tells me, it was true, ſhe had learned from the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 8. 11. That if ſhe had the Spirit of Chriſt, ſhe was his;</hi> which way ſoever the Spirit (as the author of ſpecial and diſtinguiſhing grace) pleaſed to work in her; and ſhe did believe, <hi>That if the Spirit of him who raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, dwelt in</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. That this was no more than the lot of Gods children: <hi>Aſaph</hi> (or whoever was the author of that 77 <hi>Pſalm)</hi> complained that <hi>he was ſo troubled he could not ſpeak.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 77. 4.</note>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Lord had ſilenced her Ladiſhips tongue,</hi> by his own hand laid upon it, in a continual courſe of afflictions.

                     <hi>which could not be uttered.</hi> Now <hi>groans</hi> (at leaſt) are the language of the hearts.

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:43194:150"/> degree, ſo as night and day ſhe had little reſt, beyond the influence of <hi>Anodines</hi> ſtupifying her ſenſe. As ſoon as ſhe had taken theſe, ſhe uſed to compoſe her ſelf to ſecret prayer, by and by the operation of the medicine over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took her, and inforced ſleep: when the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Anodine</hi> ceaſed, her pains re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and ſhe awoke, and then, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe compoſed her ſelf to it, her pains diſturbed her; only this ſhe added to her complaint (to find out any cauſe of which for a while poſed me.)</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>That although at firſt when ſhe compoſed her ſelf to look up to God, ſhe found not much pain; yet when ſhe was entered once into her duty, ſhe was ſure to be racked with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of her pain.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>I know that the Devil is but a ſmall friend to our communion with God, and would in what he could hinder it: I alſo knew he had a natural power (God permitting the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it) by which he could diſturb bodily humours, and divert them to an affected part; but not willing to impute it to a praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural cauſe (unleſs quite at loſs) upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deliberation, I conceived there might be this natural cauſe of it.</p>
                  <p>This good Lady deſired when ſhe ſerved the Lord, to ſerve him with her ſpirit; and when ſhe addreſſed her ſelf to God, ſummoned up all her ſpirits to do it with the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of mind, and fervour of ſpirit: Now this I conceived might be a natural cauſe of the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:43194:150"/> increaſe of her pain at ſuch a time, in regard that her ſpirits, which were wont to ſerve her body in the ſupportation of her under her affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, were at this time drawn up to another imployment; and the ſeveral parts of her body at preſent left deſtitute, it might give a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral advantage to her infirmity; but this was but my particular fancy. I told her,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That ſhort ejaculations were moſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her preſent condition, and were heard of God, as well as longer prayers; for we are not heard for our much ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I minded her of a ſpeech of Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords; If I were in health, I would deſire but to caſt one long look toward Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. I told her, <hi>it was unreaſonable for her Ladiſhip to conclude her ſelf to want the ſtrengthening influences of the holy Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as to this or that act of duty, poſſibly ſhe might not diſcern ſuch an influence of it.</hi> It was likely that if her Ladiſhip examined as to many other duties ſhe might find it, and that with an evidence not to be denied.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I further told her, the influence of the ſpirit was moſt eminently ſeen in its workings, in ſtrengthening the ſoul to thoſe exerciſes of grace, which are moſt proper for our day; the preſent condition and diſpenſation I meant, under which we are; and that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> were thoſe graces, the exerciſe whereof God more peculiarly requires of his children in a day of affliction; and if her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhip found the Spirit of God infuſing, or
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:43194:151"/> exerting theſe habits, ſhe need not doubt of the ſtrengthening influences of the Spirit: With theſe things her Lad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <q>Ah (Sir!) you told me that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> are thoſe graces, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of which is moſt proper to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and if I found the holy Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing, or ſtrengthening me to the exerciſe of theſe habits, I might be aſſured that I was not without the ſtrengthening influences of the Spirit; though I did not find ſuch an aſſiſtance as I deſired to every particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But Sir, you ſee, I am very impatient, reſtleſs in my ſelf, froward with every body about me; I cannot be ſilent under the hand of God, nor keep my ſelf from roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.

                        </gap>ed I have had what I judged a flaſh of the light of Gods countenance: Once I remember, after you had been pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me, and in your prayer mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pleaded many promiſes: it pleaſed God (as I thought) to ſeal ſome of them to my ſoul, and at ſome other times, that firſt word which God was pleaſed to ſeal unto my ſoul, 1 <hi>Col. 27. Chriſt in you the hope of Glory,</hi> hath been returned to my ſoul, and comforted me, but I cannot call
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:43194:151"/> this aſſurance; doubting quickly returned, and now Satan would have me let go alſo my hold on Chriſt, but I am reſolved not to let it go until I die; ſhall I not ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve? I beſeech you <hi>Sir,</hi> tell me, ſhould I not ſo reſolve?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I replied;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That I rejoyced to hear her Ladiſhip acknowledging, that God had ſometimes ſealed promiſed unto her ſoul; that thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions did not abide conſtant, was not to be wondred at, it being rarely the lot of any child of God to walk in the conſtant light of his countenance: but I humbly conceived her Ladiſhip had great ground to call theſe impreſſions of the Spirit of God upon a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold account.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They were made upon her ſoul after earneſt prayer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They came to one in a dark, ſad and afflicted condition, and to an awakened con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and to one who had for ſome time deſired to walk cloſe with God; and this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long and patient waiting for God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The return of that word in which the Lord had made her ſoul firſt to hope, was a great evidence to me, that the Author of the firſt, was alſo the Author of the ſecond im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I rejoyced more to her Ladiſhips grant, that her Faith of adherence was ſtrengthened, and ſo ſtrengthened, as ſhe was reſolved not to <hi>let it go until ſhe died:</hi> In which reſolution
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:43194:152"/> I humbly beſought her Ladiſhip to perſiſt; I intreated her Ladiſhip to conſider, that there are not two better marks of a ſtrong Faith, than</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The reſiſtance, and repelling of temptations to doubt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The caſting of our ſouls upon God, and adhering to the promiſe, though we want in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of ſenſe:</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>in hope above hope:</hi> This indeed is a ſtrong faith, and gives much glory to God. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I thought I never was a witneſs to the actings of a ſtronger faith, than that of this <hi>noble perſon:</hi> in the midſt of her ſaddeſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of her darkeſt hours, when ſhe was even diſtracted through pain and terrours, ſhe would cry out to all our amazement;
<q>
                        <hi>It is my ſtrong hold, I will not let it go; no, I will not let it go; I am reſolved I will not let it go; let Satan ſuggeſt what he will, it is my ſtrong hold, I have committed my ſelf unto Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Thus ſhe would cry out,</q> bitterly weeping while ſhe ſpake in great Agonies of her ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As to <hi>Patience,</hi> I deſired her Ladiſhip to conſider, that the grace of patience was not a <hi>Roman fortitude,</hi> carrying one out under an affliction, without any expreſſion of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; this an Heathen might do without any aſſiſtance of diſtinguiſhing grace: and ſome diſtempe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>atures were ſuch, as the beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians could not ſo bear them: <hi>David</hi> roared; <hi>Job</hi> complained; Chriſt himſelf cryed out,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:43194:152"/> 
                     <hi>My God, My God.</hi> Patience is a ſacred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of grace, by which we are inabled in the hour of affliction, to hope in God whom we ſee not, and meekly to ſubmit to him under his ſeverer diſpenſations, without any murmuring, repining, or any frowardneſs of behaviour. I told her, that although her Ladiſhip did ſometimes roar out, through extremity of pain, and were reſtleſs through torments; yet the grace of patience was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently made manifeſt in her ſoul, in her humble owning the Juſtice of God; kiſſing his rod; never repining, nor murmuring at his diſpenſations; only deſiring ſtrength to bear what he would pleaſe to lay upon her, and her willingneſs to die or live, as he ſhould pleaſe to order (for it was now patience in her to be content to live) finally in her wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs (in obedience to Gods command and ordinances) (though ſhe earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired death) yet to uſe all means (though ſhe had no hope of cure) to prolong a miſerable life ſo long as God pleaſed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Finally, I told her, that although poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſometimes in the height of her diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, ſome ſpeeches might ſound ſome impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and unbelief; when the extremity of her pain had almoſt totally deprived her of the uſe of her reaſon; yet God would not impute this to her; for he weighs our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances with our temptations. So the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>You have heard of the patience of Job:</hi> he that looks in the ſtory will find
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:43194:153"/> much in <hi>Job,</hi> which we ſhould call <hi>impatience;</hi> he curſed the day of his birth, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. And we find in his ſtory, many other very paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate and diſtempered ſpeeches; yet the Apoſtle ſaith not, you have heard of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and frowardneſs; but <hi>you have heard of the patience of Job.</hi> Though <hi>Job</hi> ſometimes were very impatient; yet the Lord conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jobs patience,</hi> with his <hi>temptations,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords him as a <hi>patient man,</hi> and ſo <hi>patient,</hi> as to be propounded to his Saints in following ages, as an example of patience: he ſaith not, you have heard of the <hi>paſſion</hi> or <hi>froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> but <hi>you have heard of the patience of Job.</hi> In ſhort, I told her <hi>Ladiſhip,</hi> that we who were ſpectators, could not but judge her (in the free uſe of her reaſon) full both of faith and patience: for her few diſtempered hours, as they were not in number equal to the reſt; ſo neither would her tender Father judge her for them.</p>
                  <p>By theſe, and other Arguments, through Gods aſſiſtance, ſhe ſeemed at laſt ſatisfied, that although ſhe yet wanted the conſolations of the Spirit; yet ſhe was not without the ſtrengthening influences of it.</p>
                  <p>But yet her adverſary would not leave her; his next temptation was from her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prechended want of Gods quickening grace; to which purpoſe ſhe replies again:</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Tempt.</hi> 
                     <q>Sir, I remember you told me, that though I wanted the conſolations of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:43194:153"/> the Spirit; yet if I found its quickening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, I had no reaſon to deſpond: but (Sir) I want theſe; my head, and my heart is dull; there is no life left in my ſpirit; I lift up a lifeleſs ſoul to God in prayer; never was any in ſo dull and dead a condition as I am.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I replied;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That if her Ladiſhip found the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening influences of the holy Spirit, they would evidence a ſtate of juſtification and favour with God; now thoſe were evident in her Ladiſhip; how elſe did her Ladiſhip in her dark condition, commit her ſelf unto God? reſt upon him and patiently wait for him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That as to quickening grace it was ſeen: 1. In <hi>exciting the ſoul to duty.</hi> 2. In <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the ſoul in duty,</hi> ſo as it performeth it with alacrity, delight and vigour; and for the latter, it works in us by aſſiſting us in the improvement of our natural parts and powers: now this aſſiſtance might be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her Ladiſhip, through the indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Organs, by, and through the means of which the Spirit perfecteth theſe operations: and her Ladiſhip muſt conſider, that her <hi>ſpirits</hi> were tired with ſucceſſion of pain, and ſtupified by <hi>anodines</hi> medicines, which her learned Phyſician thought proper for her for the allevation of her pain, which otherwiſe would ſoon have deſtroyed her: That her dulneſs was no more to holy duties,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:43194:154"/> than to any thing elſe, and (as I conceived) wholly occaſioned through theſe natural cauſes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, I told her it was manifeſt, that God had not wholly withdrawn his quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace from her, from her ſenſe of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſtemperature, and the quickening of her ſoul to the duty; though ſhe did not find ſuch quickening in the duty as ſhe deſired, ſhe might truly ſay, <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh.</hi> Her heart was awake to a ſenſe of her infirmity; though <hi>ſhe ſlept</hi> in reſpect of ſo full an ability to perform the duty with that <hi>life</hi> and chearfulneſs which ſhe deſired, and had formerly experienced. I further told her, that Gods deareſt ſervants, under ſad afflictions, or <hi>partial deſertions,</hi> had wanted degrees of quickening grace. How often doth <hi>David</hi> cry out, <hi>Lord quicken me,</hi> Pſal. 119. 25, 88, 154, 107. Pſal. 143, 11, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It was ſome time before ſhe could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of this, that it was an evidence of quickening grace, for her ſoul under its hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs, to be kept awake with the ſenſe of her duty, and labour under the burthen of its infirmity; but at laſt ſhe was as to this alſo in ſome meaſure ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>And now her adverſary was inforced in a great meaſure to quit all his ſtrong holds. Some of theſe temptations returned, but her judgement was eſtabliſhed, her faith ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and ſhe was never after kept long in bondage to any of them, for an hour or two,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:43194:154"/> or for a night; ſhe might be in captivity to ſome of them; but one might eaſily diſcern, from her adverſaries ſhifting from one temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to another, that his ſtrength was tired and he about to leave her ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 <hi>Tempt.</hi> Yet after this could one have thought, that <hi>her adverſary ſhould have offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any ſuggeſtion to her, to have deſtroyed her ſelf.</hi> But as to this temptation (to which her ſpiritual adverſary had a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from the inexpreſſible torturing pains which ſhe felt) ſhe was not with more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, violence, and ſubtilty moved, than through grace ſtrengthened, in the reſiſting and repelling of it: ſhe was not wont to parley with her adverſary, not affected to keep his counſels: once and again ſhe was thus ſolicited. But as God inabled her with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, to ſay, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan;</hi> ſo he g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ve her wiſdom to diſcover it to her deareſt friends, and he quickly gave over this temptation.</p>
                  <p>For ſome time before the Lord tranſlated this ſervant of his, he had prepared her for her diſſolution, by creating in her ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be <hi>diſſolved that ſhe might be with Chriſt.</hi> She was much prone to ſuſpect her own ſincerity, and would tell me.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>That ſhe ſometimes feared leſt ſhe ſhould deſire death only to be freed from her pain; but ſhe hoped ſhe did not deſire it upon that account.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:43194:155"/>
                  <p>For ſome weeks before ſhe died, ſhe had many <hi>fainting</hi> and <hi>Convulſion</hi> fits; in every one almoſt of which, we expected her change: when ſhe recovered out of any of them, ſhe would be almoſt angry at her ſouls recovery; and uſally her firſt word was, <hi>Muſt I yet live longer?</hi> I remember above ſix months before her death, I being in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> wrote a cenſolatory Letter to her Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in which I had this paſſage amongſt others:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam! if ever we come in Heaven, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly we have many months or years Journey thither, through this wilderneſs; your Ladiſhip (probably) may be there in twelve months</hi> (to that purpoſe) when I returned, her Ladiſhip thank<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>When the adverſary of her ſalvation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived he could not baffle her hope, nor make the hand of her faith to ſhake; but ſtill ſhe was reſolved to keep her hold on Chriſt, and that her ſoul was willing, yea deſirous to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 <hi>Tempt. He once more attempts to ſpoil her comfort, and moleſts her with extreme fears of a bitter death; and that her ſaith would then fail, and her courage abate.</hi> This (I think) was his laſt aſſault diſcerned by us, her
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:43194:155"/> Ladiſhip was pleaſed to impart her fears to me: I humbly beſought her <hi>Honour,</hi> that now ſhe had prevailed againſt Satans <hi>horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> ſhe would not ſuffer her ſelf to be trampled by his footmen. I told her Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That it was probable that God would give her whom he had made a combatant with ſo long, and ſharp an affliction at laſt to depart in peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it was not probable, that her dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pangs would be more ſharp and violent, than what ſhe had already indured, and was yet induring.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That ſhe had no reaſon to diſtruſt that God who had ſtrengthened her in ſo many hours and nights, and daies of torturing pain, for his aſſiſtance in the laſt hour, which if it had more of weight and bitterneſs, yet would have leſs in length.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That he in whom ſhe had truſted, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt had taken away the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of death, and payed a price for his Saints perſeverance in it; ſo that never any held out to the end, who at laſt was left, and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I defired her <hi>Ladiſhip</hi> to digeſt that text, <hi>Heb. 2. 14, 15. For as much as the children were partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo took part with them of the ſame, that through death be might deſtroy him that had the power of death, even the Devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their life-me ſubject to bondage.</hi>

                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:43194:156"/>
                  <p>Soon after this her diſtemperature yet heightened, her pains grew exceeding great, and ſo continued for ſome daies, till about 4 daies before her death, which yet it pleaſed God to inable her to endure with an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable patience, ſtill ſhe kept <hi>her hold faſt in God,</hi> profeſſing to me even in her higheſt fits of diſtemper, that <hi>the Lord was her hope; and ſhe had an hold on him, and would not let it go, let God do what he pleaſed with her, and Satan ſuggeſt what he could unto her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some ſour daies before her death, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God that her pains were in ſome degrees abated; and now by this experience of Gods ſupportation of her in her laſt ſad r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The day before ſhe died, was to her a day of great reviving; ſhe had not (of many weeks before) been ſo chearful and free from pain.</p>
                  <p>At noon coming in (as I was wont) to pray with her, I found her even raviſhed with the apprehenſions of Gods goodneſs to her, giving her ſome relaxation from pain: and I hope I ſhall not forget how earneſt ſhe was in preſſing me to praiſe the Lord with her, and for her.</p>
                  <p>After prayer ſhe continued very chearful; yet on the ſudden ſhe laid hold on my hand, and drew me to her, ſo as I perceived ſhe would whiſper ſomething in my car. I a little admired at her ſudden joy, and what
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:43194:156"/> ſhe had to ſay, inclining my head to her: when ſhe perceived her <hi>noble Siſter</hi> had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her back, and was with the reſt of the company out of hearing, ſhe tells me, <hi>I think I may tell it you, you will not ſpeak of it, I believe I am very near my Fathers houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I reſolved to keep her counſel, till I ſaw the iſſue, and the rather becauſe ſhe ſeemed to us further from death, than at any time for ſome weeks before: in this temper ſhe continued the remaining part of that day: it was the day when I was to preach my weekly Lecture; ſo that I returned not to her until the evening; when I found her as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, very chearful, and able to diſcourſe with me about a private buſineſs, as to which on the behalf of her friend, ſhe had improved her intereſt in a worthy <hi>Gentleman;</hi> ſhe had that night received a Latter from him, letting her know it was diſpatched, and took her leave of me, deſiring me to draw up a Letter of thanks to him, which ſhe would (as ſhe told me) the next day ſubſcribe, that it might be ſent by the next Poſt.</p>
                  <p>But it ſo pleaſed God, that by an inexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed turn of Providence, before morning her ſpirits failed her, and ſhe in a great meaſure loſt her ſpeech, and after ſpake very few words, only made ſigns to us to pray for her: Once ſhe ſaid, <hi>I fear,</hi> and by and by, <hi>I hope, I hope;</hi> and ſo quietly, without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any pain (ſo ſar as we could diſcern) ſhe yielded up her ſoul to God upon the 25th.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:43194:157"/> day of <hi>March,</hi> 1652. about nine of the clock.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſhe <hi>fought the good fight, and kept the faith,</hi> and hath now put on <hi>the Crown of Glory,</hi> being entred into the actual poſſeſſion, and beatifical viſion, of thoſe things which <hi>eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive; even the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi>

Having taken up this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I reſolved alſo to joyn theſe notes with them, and accordingly ſent them to a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, in whoſe hands they were <hi>Anno</hi> 1665. when the Plague hindered the printing of them; and <hi>Anno</hi> 1666. till the <hi>Dreadful Fire</hi> conſumed them. I was for ſome times after divided in my thoughts, whether to revive them or no; but at laſt finding (accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) amongſt my notes, an imperfect Copy of them; I ſet to the work, and through Gods affiſtance, have once more brought it to an iſſue; and I cannot but in it ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider the Providence of God retarding my hand to an opportunity of doing a piece of ſervice to the laſt mentioned <hi>Lady,</hi> which I never thought her <hi>honourable</hi> name for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion would have ſtood in need of.</p>
                  <p>Within theſe ſix months laſt paſt (to juſtifie if it were poſſible, the tremendous Apoſtacy of another) I hear it commonly reported amongſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that both this <hi>noble</hi>

                     <hi>Lady</hi> and <hi>her Husband</hi> died <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and that her only Son is alſo one.</p>
                  <p>For Mr. <hi>Courten,</hi> he was wholly unknown to me; I never ſaw his face; it was his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs to die in a <hi>Papiſh Country,</hi> which might give an advantage to ſuch a fiction. But his Son, <hi>William Courten,</hi> Eſquire, yet living, is a ſufficient teſtimony againſt this fabulous report, who both viſited the place ſince his Fathers death, and received the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony from a friend, which his dying Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left of his <hi>perſeverance in the communion of the Proteſtant Church,</hi> and abhorrence of the <hi>viſits</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtitious vanities</hi> with which thoſe <hi>Votaries</hi> uſe to trouble <hi>dying perſons:</hi> as alſo had a real teſtimony from the <hi>unhallowed burying place</hi> which alone the Papiſts would allow him. This, and much more, I have had from his worthy Son, which I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, as not thinking I ſhould ever have had any cauſe of ſuch a repetition. But that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Gentleman</hi> yet lives; and if any be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, and will take the pains to inquire of him, he can ſatisfie them both that his <hi>Father</hi> died no <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and that <hi>himſelf is none</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to another part of their ſabulous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, who are pleaſed in making lyes their refuge) he hath ſeen too much of the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fondneſs, the folly, and <hi>ſuperſtitious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi> of that <hi>Pageantry</hi> in Religion, to be ever <hi>proſelited</hi> to it, and is I think ſatisfied that it is juſtly to be abhorred by a ſober per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, were it only for the little influence it

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:43194:160"/> ſuch temptations. No perſon lived a more ſevere and ſtrict converſation; nor was more fearful of deceiving her ſelf with falſe hopes; nor wary in giving her ſelf grounds of hope as to the remiſſion of ſins, and the favour of God. No perſon living was more an enemy to a pompous, vain Pageantry in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; nor more affected to a <hi>ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, plainneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituality in her devotions:</hi> ſhe was an exceeding knowing, judicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the waies of God, and one who truly received the truth in a moſt ardent love of it; nor had ſhe any temptation from any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancyor relation, from any carnal enjoyment, or hope of any. Her fear for her dear Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, leſt the temptation of the place where he was, (which was <hi>Italy)</hi> ſhould have any influences on him as to Religion, was a great affliction to her; her joy as much, when by Letters received from him, ſhe underſtood his conſtancy: ſhe was earneſt with every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that came near her, to beg of God to keep him in that Country from the Idolatries and ſuperſtitions of it.
